  abstract = {This chapter reviews multiple-fiber reconstruction algorithms for
	diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and provides some initial
	comparative results for two such algorithms, q-ball imaging and PASMRI,
	on data from a typical clinical diffusion MRI acquisition. The chapter
	highlights the problems with standard approaches, such as diffusion-tensor
	MRI, to motivate a recent set of alternative approaches. The review
	concentrates on the software implementation of the new techniques.
	Results of the preliminary comparison show that PASMRI recovers the
	principal directions of simple test functions more consistently than
	q-ball imaging and produces qualitatively better results on the test
	data set. Further simulations suggest that a moderate increase in
	data quality allows q-ball, which is much faster to run, to recover
	directions with consistency comparable to that of PASMRI on the test
	data},

  abstract = {This study uses Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the optimal
	value of the diffusion weighting factor b for estimating white-matter
	fiber orientations using diffusion MRI with a standard spherical
	sampling scheme. We devise an algorithm for determining the optimal
	echo time, pulse width, and pulse separation in the pulsed-gradient
	spin-echo sequence for a specific value of b. The Monte Carlo simulations
	provide an estimate of the optimal value of b for recovering one
	and two fiber orientations. We show that the optimum is largely independent
	of the noise level in the measurements and the number of gradient
	directions and that the optimum depends only weakly on the diffusion
	anisotropy, the maximum gradient strength, and the spin-spin relaxation
	time. The optimum depends strongly on the mean diffusivity. In brain
	tissue, the optima we estimate are in the ranges [0.7, 1.0] x 10(9)
	s m(-2) and [2.2, 2.8] x 10(9) s m(-2) for the one- and two-fiber
	cases, respectively. The best b for estimating the fractional anisotropy
	is slightly higher than for estimating fiber directions in the one-fiber
	case and slightly lower in the two-fiber case. To estimate Tr(D)
	in the one-fiber case, the optimal setting is higher still. Simulations
	suggest that a ratio of high to low b measurements of 5 to 1 is a
	good compromise for measuring fiber directions and size and shape

	MR data acquired with easily achievable imaging parameters (b approximately

	that can occur at, for example, intersections of different tissue
	types or white matter fiber tracts. When these effects are significant,
	the common diffusion tensor model is inappropriate, since it is based
	on the assumption of a simple underlying diffusion process, which
	can be described by a Gaussian probability density function. A sequence
	of models of increasing complexity is obtained by truncating the
	spherical harmonic (SH) expansion of the ADC measurements at several
	orders. Further, a method is described for selection of the most
	appropriate of these models, in order to describe the data adequately

	the profile at each voxel as isotropic, anisotropic Gaussian, or
	non-Gaussian, each with reference to the underlying probability density
	function of displacement of water molecules. We use it to show that
	non-Gaussian profiles arise consistently in various regions of the

	expressions for the echo attenuation, E(q), in spin echo diffusion
	experiments, for practically all gradient waveforms and for the case
	of restricted diffusion in enclosing pores, with or without wall
	relaxation. The method, which derives from the multiple propagator
	approach of A. Caprihan et al. (1996, J. Magn. Reson. A 118, 94),
	depends on the representation of the gradient waveform by a succession
	of sharp gradient impulses. It leads to E(q) being expressed as a
	product of matrix operators corresponding quite naturally to the
	successive sandwich of phase evolution and Brownian migration events.
	Simple expressions are given for the case of the finite width gradient
	pulse PGSE experiment, the CPMG pulse train used in frequency-domain
	modulated gradient spin echo NMR, and the case of a sinusoidal waveform.
	The finite width gradient pulse PGSE and CPMG pulse trains are evaluated
	for the case of restricted diffusion between parallel reflecting
	planes. The former results agree precisely with published computer
	simulations while the latter calculation provides useful insight

  abstract = {This review deals with high b-value q-space diffusion-weighted MRI
	(DW-MRI) of neuronal tissues. It is well documented that at sufficiently
	high b-values (and high q-values) neuronal water signal decay in
	diffusion experiments is not mono-exponential. This implies the existence
	of more than one apparent diffusing component or evidence for restriction.
	The assignment of the different apparent diffusing components to
	real physical entities is not straightforward. However, the apparent
	slow diffusing component that was found to be restricted to a compartment
	of a few microns, if originating mainly from a specific pool and
	if assigned correctly, may potentially be used to obtain more specific
	MR images with regard to specific pathologies of the CNS. This review
	examines the utility of analyzing high b-value diffusion MRS and
	MRI data using the q-space approach introduced by Callaghan and by
	Cory and Garroway. This approach provides displacement probability
	maps that emphasize, at long diffusion times, the characteristics
	of the apparent slow diffusing component. Examples from excised spinal
	cord, where the experimental conditions for which the q-space analysis
	of MR diffusion data was developed can be met or approached will
	be presented. Then examples from human MS patients, where q-space
	requirement for the short gradient pulse is clearly violated, are
	presented. In the excised spinal cord studies, this approach was
	used to study spinal cord maturation and trauma, and was found to
	be more sensitive than other conventional methods in following spinal
	cord degeneration in an experimental model of vascular dementia (VaD).
	High b-value q-space DWI was also recently used to study healthy
	and MS diseased human brains. This approach was found to be very
	sensitive to the disease load in MS, compared with other conventional
	MRI methods, especially in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM)
	of MS brains. Finally, the potential diagnostic capacity embedded
	in high b-value q-space analyzed diffusion MR images is discussed.
	The potentials and caveats of this approach are outlined and experimental
	data are presented that show the effect of violating the short gradient
	pulse (SGP) approximation on the extracted parameters from the q-space

	the organization of brain systems, especially those used for cognition,

	noninvasive tracking of neuronal connections between functional regions

	We have developed noninvasive neuronal fiber tracking for use in

	water diffusion. We reconstructed fiber trajectories throughout the
	brain by tracking the direction of fastest diffusion (the fiber direction)
	from a grid of seed points, and then selected tracks that join anatomically
	or functionally (functional MRI) defined regions. We demonstrate
	diffusion tracking of fiber bundles in a variety of white matter
	classes with examples in the corpus callosum, geniculo-calcarine,
	and subcortical association pathways. Tracks covered long distances,
	navigated through divergences and tight curves, and manifested topological
	separations in the geniculo-calcarine tract consistent with tracer
	studies in animals and retinotopy studies in humans. Additionally,
	previously undescribed topologies were revealed in the other pathways.
	This approach enhances the power of modern imaging by enabling study

	many vibrations in dynamic environments, with applications to engine
	monitoring and sonar. Most work into parameter estimation of such
	signals assumes knowledge of the number of carrier frequencies. In
	this paper, we make no such assumption and use Bayesian techniques
	to address jointly the problem of model selection and parameter estimation.
	Following the work of Andrieu and Doucet, who addressed the problem
	for nonmodulated sinusoids, a posterior distribution for the parameters
	and model order is obtained. This distribution is too complicated
	for analytical extraction of moments and to sample from directly;
	therefore, we use a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC)
	algorithm to draw samples from the distribution. Some simulated examples
	are presented to illustrate the algorithm's performance},

  abstract = {As multi-dimensional complex data become more common, new regularization
	schemes tailored to those data are needed. In this paper we present
	a scheme for regularising diffusion tensor magnetic resonance (DT-MR)
	data, and more generally multi-dimensional data defined by a direction
	map and one or several magnitude maps. The scheme is divided in two
	steps. First, a variational method is proposed to restore direction
	fields with preservation of discontinuities. Its theoretical aspects
	are presented, as well as its application to the direction field
	that defines the main orientation of the diffusion tensors. The second
	step makes use of an anisotropic diffusion process to regularize
	the magnitude maps. The main idea is that for a range of data it
	is possible to use the restored direction as a prior to drive the
	regularization process in a way that preserves discontinuities and
	respects the local coherence of the magnitude map. We show that anisotropic
	diffusion is a convenient framework to implement that idea, and define
	a regularization process for the magnitude maps from our DT-MR data.
	Both steps are illustated on synthetic and real diffusion tensor
	magnetic resonance data},

	rooted in the powerful concept that during their random, diffusion-driven
	displacements molecules probe tissue structure at a microscopic scale

	process, molecular mobility in tissues may be anisotropic, as in

	anisotropy effects can be fully extracted, characterized, and exploited,

	a window on the important issue of connectivity. DTI has also been
	used to demonstrate subtle abnormalities in a variety of diseases

  abstract = {In most examples of inference and prediction, the expression of uncertainty
	about unknown quantities y on the basis of known quantities x is
	based on a model M that formalizes assumptions about how x and y
	are related. M will typically have two parts: structural assumptions
	S, such as the form of the link function and the choice of error
	distribution in a generalized linear model, and parameters theta
	whose meaning is specific to a given choice of S. It is common in
	statistical theory and practice to acknowledge parametric uncertainty
	about theta given a particular assumed structure S; it is less common
	to acknowledge structural uncertainty about S itself. A widely used
	approach involves enlisting the aid of x to specify a plausible single
	'best' choice S* for S, and then proceeding as if S* were known to
	be correct. In general this approach fails to assess and propagate
	structural uncertainty fully and may lead to miscalibrated uncertainty
	assessment about y given x. When miscalibration occurs it will often
	result in understatement of inferential or predictive uncertainty
	about y, leading to inaccurate scientific summaries and overconfident
	decisions that do not incorporate sufficient hedging against uncertainty.
	In this paper I discuss a Bayesian approach to solving this problem
	that has long been available in principle but is only now becoming
	routinely feasible, by virtue of recent computational advances, and
	examine its implementation in examples that involve forecasting the

  abstract = {The diffusion in voxels with multidirectional fibers can be quite
	complicated and not necessarily well characterized by the standard
	diffusion tensor model. High angular resolution diffusion-weighted
	acquisitions have recently been proposed as a method to investigate
	such voxels, but the reconstruction methods proposed require sophisticated
	estimation schemes. We present here a simple algorithm for the identification
	of diffusion anisotropy based upon the variance of the estimated
	apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a function of measurement
	direction. The rationale for this method is discussed, and results
	in normal human subjects acquired with a novel diffusion-weighted
	stimulated-echo spiral acquisition are presented which distinguish
	areas of anisotropy that are not apparent in the relative anisotropy
	maps derived from the standard diffusion tensor model. Published

  abstract = {We propose a methodology for Bayesian model determination in decomposable
	graphical Gaussian models. To achieve this aim we consider a hyper
	inverse Wishart prior distribution on the concentration matrix for
	each given graph. To ensure compatibility across models, such prior
	distributions are obtained by marginalisation from the prior conditional
	on the complete graph. We explore alternative structures for the
	hyperparameters of the latter, and their consequences for the model.
	Model determination is carried out by implementing a reversible jump
	Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. In particular, the dimension-changing
	move we propose involves adding or dropping an edge from the graph.
	We characterise the set of moves which preserve the decomposability
	of the graph, giving a fast algorithm for maintaining the junction
	tree representation of the graph at each sweep. As state variable,
	we use the incomplete variance-covariance matrix, containing only
	the elements for which the corresponding element of the inverse is
	nonzero. This allows all computations to be performed locally, at
	the clique level, which is a clear advantage for the analysis of
	large and complex datasets. Finally, the statistical and computational
	performance of the procedure is illustrated by mean of both artificial

  abstract = {This paper presents an effective jump-diffusion method for segmenting
	a range image and its associated reflectance image in the Bayesian
	framework. The algorithm works on complex real-world scenes (indoor
	and outdoor), which consist of an unknown number of objects (or surfaces)
	of various sizes and types, such as planes, conics, smooth surfaces,
	and cluttered objects (like trees and bushes). Formulated in the
	Bayesian framework, the posterior probability is distributed over
	a solution space with a countable number of subspaces of varying
	dimensions. The algorithm simulates Markov chains with both reversible
	jumps and stochastic diffusions to traverse the solution space. The
	reversible jumps realize the moves between subspaces of different
	dimensions, such as switching surface models and changing the number
	of objects. The stochastic Langevin equation realizes diffusions
	within each subspace. To achieve effective computation, the algorithm
	precomputes some importance proposal probabilities over multiple
	scales through Hough transforms, edge detection, and data clustering.
	The latter are used by the Markov chains for fast mixing. The algorithm
	is tested on 100 1D simulated data sets for performance analysis
	on both accuracy and speed. Then, the algorithm is applied to three
	data sets of range images under the same parameter setting. The results

	the encoding magnetic field gradient. The diffusion coefficient can
	be interpreted as the sum of the corresponding coefficients measured
	along the principal diffusion axes, weighted by the squares of the
	directional cosines of the encoding direction with respect to the

  abstract = {This article examines functional and anatomical connectivity in healthy
	human subjects measured with magnetic resonance imaging methods.
	Anatomical connectivity in white matter is obtained from measurements
	of the diffusion tensor. A Monte-Carlo simulation determines the
	probability that a particle diffuses between two points, with the
	probability of a jump in a particular direction from a given voxel
	being based on the local value of the diffusion tensor components.
	Functional connectivity between grey matter pixels is assessed without
	recourse to a specific activation paradigm, by calculating the correlation
	coefficient between random fluctuations in the blood oxygenation
	level-dependent signal time course in different pixels. The methods
	are used to examine the anatomical and functional connectivities
	between crowns of adjacent gyri. A high functional connectivity was
	found between grey matter pixels, with white matter displaying only
	very low correlation. A comparison of the measurements of anatomical
	and functional connectivity found that there is no simple correlation
	between these measures, except that low values of functional connectivity
	were not found together with high values of anatomical connectivity.
	Furthermore pairs of regions situated around the central sulcus indicated
	a dependence of the two connectivity measures on each other. These
	results are in accordance with an interpretation that regions which
	are clearly directly linked by white matter fiber tracts should show
	high functional connectivity, but that the inverse need not be true
	as functional connectivity may also be indirectly mediated via more
	distant grey matter regions},

	MDT model, however, did not only detect crossings but also yielded
	the single fiber directions. The FACT algorithm and a probabilistic
	connectivity algorithm were extended to support the MDT model. For
	example, a mean angular error smaller than 10 degrees was found for
	the MDT model in a simulated fiber crossing with an SNR of 80. By

	MCMC. Measurements are processed sequentially (with an artificial
	"time-line" if there is no natural one associated with the measurements)
	by SIS, which is computationally inexpensive. After each measurement
	is processed, the rejuvenation test checks whether the resulting
	SIS particles have to be rejuvenated. When indicated by the test,
	the particles are completely rejuvenated by MCMC, which removes errors
	that accumulate from SIS due to the finite number of particles, thus
	ensuring stability.. Whenever possible, the SIS particles can be
	used to advantage in the MCMC. There is flexibility in the choice

	lacking. This study presents the first validation of the principal
	eigenvector of the diffusion tensor in defining axonal fiber orientation
	by superimposing DTMRI with manganese-enhanced MRI of optic tracts.
	A rat model was developed in which optic tracts were enhanced by

	agent and can be uptaken and transported actively along the axon.
	Based on this property, we obtained enhanced optic tracts with a

	of Mn(2+). The images were compared with DTMRI acquired with exact
	spatial registration. Deviation angles between tangential vectors
	of the enhanced tracts and the principal eigenvectors of the diffusion
	tensor were then computed pixel by pixel. We found that under signal-to-noise
	(SNR) of 30, the variance of deviation angles was (13.27 degrees).
	In addition, the dependence of this variance on SNR obeys stochastic
	behavior if SNR is greater than 10. Based on this relation, we estimated
	that an rms deviation of less than 10 degrees could be achieved with
	DTMRI when SNR is 40 or greater. In conclusion, our method bypasses

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is known to have a limited capability
	of resolving multiple fiber orientations within one voxel. This is
	mainly because the probability density function (PDF) for random
	spin displacement is non-Gaussian in the confining environment of
	biological tissues and, thus, the modeling of self-diffusion by a
	second-order tensor breaks down. The statistical property of a non-Gaussian
	diffusion process is characterized via the higher-order tensor (HOT)
	coefficients by reconstructing the PDF of the random spin displacement.
	Those HOT coefficients can be determined by combining a series of
	complex diffusion-weighted measurements. The signal equation for
	an MR diffusion experiment was investigated theoretically by generalizing
	Fick's law to a higher-order partial differential equation (PDE)
	obtained via Kramers-Moyal expansion. A relationship has been derived
	between the HOT coefficients of the PDE and the higher-order cumulants
	of the random spin displacement. Monte-Carlo simulations of diffusion
	in a restricted environment with different geometrical shapes were
	performed, and the strengths and weaknesses of both HOT and established
	diffusion analysis techniques were investigated. The generalized
	diffusion tensor formalism is capable of accurately resolving the
	underlying spin displacement for complex geometrical structures,
	of which neither conventional DTI nor diffusion-weighted imaging
	at high angular resolution (HARD) is capable. The HOT method helps
	illuminate some of the restrictions that are characteristic of these
	other methods. Furthermore, a direct relationship between HOT and
	q-space is also established},

  abstract = {In q-space diffusion NMR, the probability P(r,td) of a molecule having
	a displacement r in a diffusion time td is obtained under the assumption
	that the diffusion-encoding gradient g has an infinitesimal duration.
	However, this assumption may not always hold, particularly in human
	MRI where the diffusion-encoding gradient duration delta is typically
	of the same order of magnitude as the time offset Delta between encoding
	gradients. In this case, finite-delta effects complicate the interpretation
	of displacement probabilities measured in q-space MRI, and the form
	by which the signal intensity relates to them. By considering the
	displacement-specific dephasing, <r/eiphi>, of a set of spins accumulating
	a constant displacement vector r in the total time Delta+delta during
	which diffusion is encoded, the probability recovered by a finite-delta
	q-space experiment can be interpreted. It is shown theoretically
	that a data analysis using a modified q-space index q=gammadeltaetag,
	with gamma the gyromagnetic ratio and eta=square root (Delta-delta/3)/(Delta+delta),
	recovers the correct displacement probability distribution if diffusion
	is multi-Gaussian free diffusion. With this analysis, we show that
	the displacement distribution P(r,texp) is measured at the experimental
	diffusion-encoding time texp=Delta+delta, and not at the reduced
	diffusion time tr=Delta-delta/3 as is generally assumed in the NMR
	and MRI literature. It is also shown that, by defining a probability
	P(y,Delta) that a time t<delta exists such that a displacement y
	occurs from time t to t+Delta, it is possible to describe the physical
	significance of the result obtained when we use the q-space formalism
	valid for infinitesimal delta when delta is not infinitesimal. These
	deductions were confirmed by simulations for homogeneous Gaussian
	diffusion and for heterogeneous diffusion in permeable microscopic
	Gaussian domains that are homogeneous on the microm scale. The results
	also hold for diffusion inside restricted spherical reflecting domains,
	but only if the radius of the domain is larger than a critical size.
	The simulations of the displacement-specific dephasing obtain that
	if delta>deltac then eta is not equal to square root (Delta-delta/3)/(Delta+delta)
	which implies that we can no longer obtain the correct displacement
	probability from the displacement distribution. In the case that
	/g/=18 mT/m and Delta-delta=5 ms, the parameter deltac in ms is given
	by "deltac=0.49a2+0.24" where a is the sphere's radius expressed
	in microm. Simulation of q-space restricted diffusion MRI experiments
	indicate that if eta=square root (Delta-delta/3)/(Delta+delta), the
	recovered displacement probability is always better than the Gaussian
	approximation, and the measured diffusion coefficient matches the
	diffusion coefficient at time texp=Delta+delta better than it matches
	the diffusion coefficient at time tr=Delta-delta/3. These results
	indicate that q-space MRI measurements of displacement probability
	distributions are theoretically possible in biological tissues using
	finite-duration diffusion-encoding gradients provided certain compartment
	size and diffusion encoding gradient duration constraints are met},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of model selection and accounting for model
	uncertainty in high-dimensional contingency tables, motivated by
	expert system applications. The approach most used currently is a
	stepwise strategy guided by tests based on approximate asymptotic
	P values leading to the selection of a single model; inference is
	then conditional on the selected model. The sampling properties of
	such a strategy are complex, and the failure to take account of model
	uncertainty leads to underestimation of uncertainty about quantities
	of interest. In principle, a panacea is provided by the standard
	Bayesian formalism that averages the posterior distributions of the
	quantity of interest under each of the models, weighted by their
	posterior model probabilities. Furthermore, this approach is optimal
	in the sense of maximizing predictive ability. But this has not been
	used in practice, because computing the posterior model probabilities
	is hard and the number of models is very large (often greater than
	10(11)). We argue that the standard Bayesian formalism is unsatisfactory
	and propose an alternative Bayesian approach that, we contend, takes
	full account of the true model uncertainty by averaging over a much
	smaller set of models. An efficient search algorithm is developed
	for finding these models. We consider two classes of graphical models
	that arise in expert systems: the recursive causal models and the
	decomposable log-linear models. For each of these, we develop efficient
	ways of computing exact Bayes factors and hence posterior model probabilities.
	For the decomposable log-linear models, this is based on properties
	of chordal graphs and hyper-Markov prior distributions and the resultant
	calculations can be carried out locally. The end product is an overall
	strategy for model selection and accounting for model uncertainty
	that searches efficiently through the very large classes of models
	involved. Three examples are given. The first two concern data sets
	that have been analyzed by several authors in the context of model
	selection. The third addresses a urological diagnostic problem. In
	each example, our model averaging approach provides better out-of-sample
	predictive performance than any single model that might reasonably
	have been selected},

	The Bloch-Torrey equation is modified to include a diffusion term

	quantifying diffusive attenuation in complicated geometries. This
	makes it possible to calculate the components of higher-rank tensors

	General theoretical relations between the diffusion tensor (DT) components
	measured by traditional (rank-2) DT imaging (DTI) and 3D distribution
	of diffusivities, as measured by high angular resolution diffusion
	imaging (HARDI) methods, are derived. Also, the spherical tensor

	The inadequacy of the traditional rank-2 tensor model is demonstrated

	the orientation of the principal direction of diffusion defined for
	each image voxel. Running the streamline process repeatedly using
	Monte Carlo methods to exploit this inherent uncertainty generates
	maps of connection probability. Uncertainty is defined by interpreting
	the shape of the diffusion orientation profile provided by the diffusion

	for describing the uncertainty in the diffusion tensor are proposed
	and maps of probability of connection to chosen start points or regions
	are generated in a number of major tracts. CONCLUSION: The methods

	In the corpus callosum and pyramidal tracts, the ratio of parallel

	hypoperfused, but not irreversibly damaged, tissue surrounding the
	ischemic core. The purpose of this study was to determine viability
	thresholds in the ischemic penumbra, defined as the perfusion/diffusion
	mismatch in hyperacute stroke, by the use of diffusion- and perfusion-weighted
	MRI (DWI and PWI, respectively). METHODS: DWI and PWI were performed
	in 11 patients </=6 hours after the onset of symptoms of acute ischemic
	stroke. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed covering the ischemic
	core (ROI 1), the penumbra that progressed to infarction on the basis
	of follow-up scans (ROI 2), and the penumbra that recovered (ROI
	3). The ratios of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), relative cerebral
	blood volume (rCBV), mean transit time (MTT), and apparent diffusion
	coefficient were calculated as lesion ROIs relative to the contralateral
	mirror ROIS: RESULTS: The post hoc analysis showed that the penumbra
	progressed to infarction at the following cutoff values: rCBF <0.59
	and MTT >1.63. Higher sensitivity and accuracy in predicting outcome
	of the penumbra were obtained from the rCBF maps compared with the
	rCBV and MTT maps. The initial rCBV and apparent diffusion coefficient
	ratios did not differentiate between the part of the penumbra that
	recovered and the part that progressed to infarction. The mean rCBF
	ratio was optimal in distinguishing the parts of the penumbra recovering
	or progressing to infarction. CONCLUSIONS: The thresholds found in
	this study by combined DWI/PWI might aid in the selection of patients
	suitable for therapeutic intervention within 6 hours. However, these
	hypothesized thresholds need to be prospectively tested at the voxel
	level on a larger patient sample before they can be applied clinically},

  abstract = {Diffusion of molecules in brain and other tissues is important in
	a wide range of biological processes and measurements ranging from
	the delivery of drugs to diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.
	Diffusion tensor imaging is a powerful noninvasive method to characterize
	neuronal tissue in the human brain in vivo. As a first step toward
	understanding the relationship between the measured macroscopic apparent
	diffusion tensor and underlying microscopic compartmental geometry
	and physical properties, we treat a white matter fascicle as an array
	of identical thick-walled cylindrical tubes arranged periodically
	in a regular lattice and immersed in an outer medium. Both square
	and hexagonal arrays are considered. The diffusing molecules may
	have different diffusion coefficients and concentrations (or densities)
	in different domains, namely within the tubes' inner core, membrane,
	myelin sheath, and within the outer medium. Analytical results are
	used to explore the effects of a large range of microstructural and
	compositional parameters on the apparent diffusion tensor and the
	degree of diffusion anisotropy, allowing the characterization of
	diffusion in normal physiological conditions as well as changes occurring
	in development, disease, and aging. Implications for diffusion tensor
	imaging and for the possible in situ estimation of microstructural
	parameters from diffusion-weighted MR data are discussed in the context
	of this modeling framework},

  abstract = {Water diffusion in brain tissue is affected by the presence of barriers
	to translational motion such as cell membranes and myelin fibers.
	The measured water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value is
	therefore frequently anisotropic and varies depending upon the orientation
	of restricting barriers (such as white matter tracts) relative to
	the diffusion-sensitive-gradient direction. Anisotropic water diffusion
	can be specified using indices of diffusion anisotropy [e.g. standard
	deviation of the individual ADC values, fractional anisotropy (FA),
	lattice index (LI)], which are derived from measurements of the full
	diffusion tensor. The rotationally invariant nature of particular
	diffusion anisotropy indices (e.g. FA, LI) allows orientation-independent
	comparisons of these parameters between different subjects. Pathophysiological
	processes (such as cerebral ischemia) that modify the integrity of
	the tissue microstructure result in significant alterations in tissue
	anisotropy and make this metric a useful endpoint for characterizing
	the temporal evolution of the disease. Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI)
	studies of both experimental and human stroke suggest that DTI may
	provide additional information about the evolution of the disease
	that is not available from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) alone. Acute
	reductions in the average diffusivity [<D> = (lambda(1) + lambda(2)
	+ lambda(3))/3 where lambda(1), lambda(2), and lambda(3) are the
	eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor] following the onset of cerebral
	ischemia are often accompanied by increases in diffusion anisotropy.
	In the transition from acute to sub-acute and chronic stroke, <D>
	renormalizes and subsequently increases whereas diffusion anisotropy
	measures (e.g. FA) decline and remained reduced in chronic infarcts.
	Overall isotropic ADC changes during infarct evolution have been
	observed to be greater in white matter (WM) than in gray matter (GM)
	lesions (although there have been conflicting reports on this issue)
	and GM lesions tend to renormalize prior to WM lesions as the infarct
	evolves. Ischemic WM exhibits a significant decrease in diffusion
	anisotropy (relative to normal WM) during ischemic evolution whereas
	that of ischemic GM remains statistically unchanged. Furthermore,
	the percentage decrease in ischemic WM <D> is largely determined
	by reductions in lambda(1), the eigenvalue that coincides with the
	long axis of the WM fiber tract. Variations in unidirectional ADC
	or <D> over the ischemic time course limit the usefulness of this
	parameter alone as a predictor of ischemic injury. Consequently,
	ADC information has been combined with that of other MR parameters
	(including DTI) to unambiguously stage and predict ischemic brain
	injury over its entire temporal evolution. Combined <D> and diffusion
	anisotropy measurements have identified three phases of diffusion
	abnormality: (1) reduced <D> and elevated anisotropy; (2) reduced
	<D> and reduced anisotropy; and (3) elevated <D> and reduced anisotropy.
	However, variations in the differential patterns of <D> and diffusion
	anisotropy evolution have been observed by a number of investigators
	and more work is needed to clarify the role of these measurements
	in characterizing the severity of the ischemic insult as well as
	the potential outcome in response to the initial ischemic injury.
	The use of DTI, in combination with more sophisticated analysis methods
	for performing multiparametric segmentation, such as multispectral
	analysis, may enhance the use of MRI for accurate diagnosis and prognosis
	of stroke. Furthermore, these techniques may also play an important
	role in the clinical evaluation of new stroke treatments},

	By assuming the spin phase fluctuation and/or the randomness of spin

	spin echo sequences to provide information about the average diffusion

	information, a measured displacement profile has to be related by
	means of a model to the physical and geometrical properties of the
	tissue, such as diffusion coefficients and shapes of semi-permeable
	membranes of compartments in the system. The behavior of the NMR
	signal and the measured ADC are greatly affected by the cellular
	architecture of a tissue, mainly because cellular membranes are relatively
	impermeable to water. For long diffusion times, and small signal
	attenuations, ADC is relatively insensitive to how it is measured.
	In general, however, ADC values are not readily interpreted unless
	the measuring conditions are specified in detail. For given measuring
	conditions, ADC depends on intra- and extracellular diffusion coefficients,
	membrane permeabilities, cell sizes and the cellular volume fraction.
	If intra- and extracellular T2 relaxation rates are different enough,

	tensor is the model most commonly used to derive the orientation

	to fail in regions containing several fiber populations with distinct
	orientations. A number of alternative models have been suggested,

  abstract = {In this paper, the Bayesian Theory is used to formulate the Inverse
	Problem (IP) of the EEG/MEG. This formulation offers a comparison
	framework for the wide range of inverse methods available and allows
	us to address the problem of model uncertainty that arises when dealing
	with different solutions for a single data. In this case, each model
	is defined by the set of assumptions of the inverse method used,
	as well as by the functional dependence between the data and the
	Primary Current Density (PCD) inside the brain. The key point is
	that the Bayesian Theory not only provides for posterior estimates
	of the parameters of interest (the PCD) for a given model, but also
	gives the possibility of finding posterior expected utilities unconditional
	on the models assumed. In the present work, this is achieved by considering
	a third level of inference that has been systematically omitted by
	previous Bayesian formulations of the IP. This level is known as
	Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The new approach is illustrated in
	the case of considering different anatomical constraints for solving
	the IP of the EEG in the frequency domain. This methodology allows
	us to address two of the main problems that affect linear inverse
	solutions (LIS): (a) the existence of ghost sources and (b) the tendency
	to underestimate deep activity. Both simulated and real experimental
	data are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the BMA approach,
	and some of the results are compared with the solutions obtained
	using the popular low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA)
	and its anatomically constraint version (cLORETA)},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a powerful
	tool for mapping neural histoarchitecture in vivo. However, DTI can
	only resolve a single fiber orientation within each imaging voxel
	due to the constraints of the tensor model. For example, DTI cannot
	resolve fibers crossing, bending, or twisting within an individual
	voxel. Intravoxel fiber crossing can be resolved using q-space diffusion
	imaging, but q-space imaging requires large pulsed field gradients
	and time-intensive sampling. It is also possible to resolve intravoxel
	fiber crossing using mixture model decomposition of the high angular
	resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) signal, but mixture modeling
	requires a model of the underlying diffusion process.Recently, it
	has been shown that the HARDI signal can be reconstructed model-independently
	using a spherical tomographic inversion called the Funk-Radon transform,
	also known as the spherical Radon transform. The resulting imaging
	method, termed q-ball imaging, can resolve multiple intravoxel fiber
	orientations and does not require any assumptions on the diffusion
	process such as Gaussianity or multi-Gaussianity. The present paper
	reviews the theory of q-ball imaging and describes a simple linear

	radial basis function interpolation. Open aspects of the q-ball reconstruction

  abstract = {Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging holds substantial promise
	as a technique for non-invasive imaging of white matter (WM) axonal
	projections. For diffusion imaging to be capable of providing new
	insight into the connectional neuroanatomy of the human brain, it
	will be necessary to histologically validate the technique against
	established tracer methods such as horseradish peroxidase and biocytin
	histochemistry. The macaque monkey provides an ideal model for histological
	validation of the diffusion imaging method due to the phylogenetic
	proximity between humans and macaques, the gyrencephalic structure
	of the macaque cortex, the large body of knowledge on the neuroanatomic

	it has been shown that high angular resolution diffusion imaging
	(HARDI) can resolve multiple axon orientations within an individual
	imaging voxel in human WM. This capability promises to boost the
	accuracy of tract reconstructions from diffusion imaging. If the
	macaque is to serve as a model for histological validation of the
	diffusion tractography method, it will be necessary to show that
	HARDI can also resolve intravoxel architecture in macaque WM. The
	present study therefore sought to test whether the technique can
	resolve intravoxel structure in macaque WM. Using a HARDI method
	called q-ball imaging (QBI) it was possible to resolve composite
	intravoxel architecture in a number of anatomic regions. QBI resolved
	intravoxel structure in, for example, the dorsolateral convexity,

	levels of the brainstem as well as to assess differences due to age,
	gender, and laterality. In all subjects, anisotropy was highest in
	the cerebral peduncle, lowest in the caudal pons, and intermediate
	in the medulla. In the pons and medulla the regional variability
	was high, with significant differences in anisotropy even between
	contiguous slices. Multifactorial ANOVA (performed using the average
	value of anisotropy within each region of interest) revealed that
	elderly subjects had significantly lower values than young subjects
	in the cerebral peduncle, with no differences in the pons and medulla.
	No significant differences in anisotropy due to gender and side were
	found. The differences in anisotropy at different levels of the brainstem
	reflect differences in the local architecture of white matter fibers.
	Anisotropy is high in the cerebral peduncle because fibers have a
	highly ordered arrangement, while in the pons and medulla, anisotropy
	is lower because the local fiber architecture is less coherent due
	to the presence of other fibers and nuclei. The biologic meaning
	of the intergroup differences in anisotropy is discussed in light
	of the structure and architecture of the tissue under investigation.
	We also consider potential sources of artifacts, such as noise and
	motion, partial volume contamination, anatomic mismatching, and the
	use of inappropriate statistical tests. We conclude that the age-related
	decrease in anisotropy in the cerebral peduncle is not artifactual

	the Stejskal-Tanner diffusion equation system whereby a dual tensor

	eliminates the need to solve this equation for each voxel. We further
	describe decomposition of the diffusion tensor based on its symmetrical
	properties, which in turn describe the geometry of the diffusion

	the MR signal in most regions of a human brain. A substantial distribution
	width, on the order of 36% of the ADC, was found for practically

	Each of these areas receives a large number of afferent inputs from
	other cortical areas (and elsewhere) and in return issues a large
	number of output projections. The cortex is thus innervated by a
	very large number of cortico-cortical connections, so that the areas
	and their interconnections form a network of startling complexity.
	The complexity of this network presents a formidable topological
	problem that hinders understanding of its organization. Recently,
	however, an optimization analysis has been applied to the connections
	between visual cortical areas. This optimization analysis derived
	a structure for the cortical visual system, a system whose organization
	has been extensively explored, that is consistent with known organizational
	features. This paper concerns an application of the same approach
	to the cortico-cortical connections of other major sensory systems
	in the primate brain, and to the connections of the entire cerebral
	cortex, whose organizations have not been extensively explored. The
	latter analysis suggests the gross topological organization of the
	cortical information processing system of this animal, and shows
	the 'place' of individual areas within this organization. The results

  abstract = {A new rotation-invariant spherical harmonic decomposition (SHD) method
	is proposed in this paper for analyzing high angular resolution diffusion
	(HARD) imaging. Regular SHD methods have been used to characterize
	the features of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) profile
	measured by the HARD technique. However, these regular SHD methods
	are rotation-variant, i.e., the magnitude and/or the phase of the
	harmonic components changes with the rotation of the ADC profile.
	We propose a new rotation-invariant SHD (RI-SHD) method based on
	the rotation-invariant property of a diffusion tensor model. The
	basic idea of the proposed method is to reorient the measured ADC
	profile into a local coordinate system determined by the three eigenvectors
	of the diffusion tensor in each imaging voxel, and then apply a SHD
	to the ADC profile. Both simulations and in vivo experiments were
	carried out to validate the method. Comparisons were made between
	the component maps from a regular SHD method, diffusion circular
	spectrum mapping (DCSM) method and the proposed RI-SHD method. The
	results indicate that the regular SHD maps vary significantly with
	the rotation of the diffusion-encoding scheme, whereas the maps of
	the DCSM and the proposed method remain unchanged. In particular,
	the (0,0)-th, (2,2)-th and (4,4)-th component maps from the RI-SHD
	method exhibited good consistency with the 0th, 2nd and 4th order
	maps of the DCSM method, respectively. Compared with the regular
	SHD methods used in HARD imaging, the proposed RI-SHD method is superior
	in characterizing the diffusion patterns of multiple fiber structures

	In a previous study [Zhan, W., Gu, H., Xu, S., Silbersweig, D.A.,

	fiber structures based on high angular resolution apparent diffusion

	the magnitude of the 4th-order harmonic of the diffusion circular
	spectrum can be used to identify the existence of fiber crossings.
	However, the orientation of the intravoxel crossing fibers remained
	unknown. This study extends the diffusion circular spectrum mapping
	method so that it is able to identify the orientation of the intravoxel
	crossing fibers by utilizing the phase information of the circular
	spectrum. In general, the phase of the circular harmonic determines
	the rotation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) profile
	on the sampling circle that is spanned by the major and medium eigenvector
	of the diffusion tensor and thus can be used to determine the orientation
	of the crossing fibers. Simulation results show that the regular
	tensor-based major eigenvector maps have obvious artifacts in the
	fiber-crossing area, whereas the estimated crossing fibers by the
	proposed method are much more consistent with the orientation of
	the actual intravoxel fibers. Diffusion MRI experiments were performed
	on five healthy human brains using a 3T scanner. The brain regions
	with fiber crossings were selected by thresholding the magnitudes
	of the 4th-order circular spectrum map. Intravoxel crossing fibers
	were estimated by the phase of the 4th-order harmonic for each voxel
	within these areas. The estimated intravoxel crossing fibers demonstrated
	a clear consistency with the orientations of fiber tracks in the
