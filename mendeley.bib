We have used an intracellular cytokine staining technique to demonstrate that the proportion of ex vivo peripheral blood CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets expressing IFN-gamma is increased in secondary progressing (SP) MS patients, whereas the values in untreated relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients are reduced compared with those of controls. Patients treated with interferon-beta (IFN-beta) have an even more significant reduction in the percentage of IFN-gamma-secreting cells. The finding that the number of IFN-gamma-expressing CD8 cells is increased in SPMS patients, a group with reduced functional suppressor activity, and is most significantly reduced by IFN-beta therapy, which increases suppressor activity, indicates that IFN-gamma secretion by CD8 T cells and functional suppressor defects attributed to this cell subset in MS can be dissociated.},

abstract = {Novel methodologies have been recently developed to characterize the microgeometry of neural tissues and porous structures via diffusion MRI data. In line with these previous works, this article provides a detailed mathematical description of q-space in spherical coordinates that helps to highlight the differences and similarities between various related q-space methodologies proposed to date such as q-ball imaging (QBI), diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), and diffusion orientation transform imaging (DOT). This formulation provides a direct relationship between the orientation distribution function (ODF) and the diffusion data without using any approximation. Under this relationship, the exact ODF can be computed by means of the Radon transform of the radial projection (in q-space) of the diffusion MRI signal. This new methodology, termed exact q-ball imaging (EQBI), was put into practice using an analytical ODF estimation in terms of spherical harmonics that allows obtaining model-free and model-based reconstructions. This work provides a new framework for combining information coming from diffusion data recorded on multiple spherical shells in q-space (hybrid diffusion imaging encoding scheme), which is capable of mapping ODF to a high accuracy. This represents a step toward a more efficient development of diffusion MRI experiments for obtaining better ODF estimates.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has seen increased usage in clinical and basic science research in the past decade. By assessing the water diffusion anisotropy within biological tissues, e.g. brain, researchers can infer different fiber structures important for neural pathways. A typical DTI data set contains at least one base image and six diffusion-weighted images along non-collinear encoding directions. The resultant images can then be combined to derive the three principal axes of the diffusion tensor and their respective cross terms, which can in turn be used to compute fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and to construct axonal fibers. The above operations all assume that DTI images along different diffusion-weighting directions for the same brain register to each other without spatial distortions. This assumption is generally false, as the large diffusion-weighting gradients would usually induce eddy currents to generate diffusion-weighting direction-dependent field gradients, leading to mis-registration within the DTI data set. Traditional methods for correcting magnetic field-induced distortions do not usually take into account these direction-dependent eddy currents unique for DTI, and they are usually time-consuming because multiple phase images need to be acquired. In this report, we describe our theory and implementation of an efficient and effective method to correct for the main field and eddy current-induced direction-dependent distortions for DTI images under a unified framework to facilitate the daily practice of DTI acquisitions.},

abstract = {Visual exploration is essential to the visualization and analysis of densely sampled 3D DTI fibers in biological specimens, due to the high geometric, spatial, and anatomical complexity of fiber tracts. Previous methods for DTI fiber visualization use zooming, color-mapping, selection, and abstraction to deliver the characteristics of the fibers. However, these schemes mainly focus on the optimization of visualization in the 3D space where cluttering and occlusion make grasping even a few thousand fibers difficult. This paper introduces a novel interaction method that augments the 3D visualization with a 2D representation containing a low-dimensional embedding of the DTI fibers. This embedding preserves the relationship between the fibers and removes the visual clutter that is inherent in 3D renderings of the fibers. This new interface allows the user to manipulate the DTI fibers as both 3D curves and 2D embedded points and easily compare or validate his or her results in both domains. The implementation of the framework is GPU based to achieve real-time interaction. The framework was applied to several tasks, and the results show that our method reduces the user's workload in recognizing 3D DTI fibers and permits quick and accurate DTI fiber selection.},

abstract = {The assessment of Diffusion-Weighted MRI (DW-MRI) fibre-tracking algorithms has been limited by the lack of an appropriate 'gold standard'. Practical limitations of alternative methods and physical models have meant that numerical simulations have become the method of choice in practice. However, previous numerical phantoms have consisted of separate fibres embedded in homogeneous backgrounds, which do not capture the true nature of white matter. In this paper we describe a method that is able to randomly generate numerical structures consisting of densely packed bundles of fibres, which are much more representative of human white matter, and simulate the DW-MR images that would arise from them under many imaging conditions. User-defined parameters may be adjusted to produce structures with a range of complexities that spans the levels we would expect to find in vivo. These structures are shown to contain many different features that occur in human white matter and which could confound fibre-tracking algorithms, such as tract kissing and crossing. Furthermore, combinations of such features can be sampled by the random generation of many different structures with consistent levels of complexity. The proposed software provides means for quantitative assessment via direct comparison between tracking results and the exact location of the generated fibres. This should greatly improve our understanding of algorithm performance and therefore prove an important tool for fibre tracking development.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose a new method to optimize the ordering of gradient directions in diffusion-weighted MRI so that partial scans have the best spherical coverage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diffusion-weighted MRI often uses a spherical sampling scheme, which acquires images sequentially with diffusion-weighting gradients in unique directions distributed isotropically on the hemisphere. If not all of the measurements can be completed, the quality of diffusion tensors fitted to the partial scan is sensitive to the order of the gradient directions in the scanner protocol. If the directions are in a random order, then a partial scan may cover some parts of the hemisphere densely but other parts sparsely and thus provide poor spherical coverage. We compare the results of ordering with previously published methods for optimizing the acquisition in simulation. RESULTS: Results show that all methods produce similar results and all improve the accuracy of the estimated diffusion tensors significantly over unordered acquisitions. CONCLUSION: The new ordering method improves the spherical coverage of partial scans and has the advantage of maintaining the optimal coverage of the complete scan.},

abstract = {Lightness illusions are fundamental to human perception, and yet why we see them is still the focus of much research. Here we address the question by modelling not human physiology or perception directly as is typically the case but our natural visual world and the need for robust behaviour. Artificial neural networks were trained to predict the reflectance of surfaces in a synthetic ecology consisting of 3-D "dead-leaves" scenes under non-uniform illumination. The networks learned to solve this task accurately and robustly given only ambiguous sense data. In addition--and as a direct consequence of their experience--the networks also made systematic "errors" in their behaviour commensurate with human illusions, which includes brightness contrast and assimilation--although assimilation (specifically White's illusion) only emerged when the virtual ecology included 3-D, as opposed to 2-D scenes. Subtle variations in these illusions, also found in human perception, were observed, such as the asymmetry of brightness contrast. These data suggest that "illusions" arise in humans because (i) natural stimuli are ambiguous, and (ii) this ambiguity is resolved empirically by encoding the statistical relationship between images and scenes in past visual experience. Since resolving stimulus ambiguity is a challenge faced by all visual systems, a corollary of these findings is that human illusions must be experienced by all visual animals regardless of their particular neural machinery. The data also provide a more formal definition of illusion: the condition in which the true source of a stimulus differs from what is its most likely (and thus perceived) source. As such, illusions are not fundamentally different from non-illusory percepts, all being direct manifestations of the statistical relationship between images and scenes.},

abstract = {Quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become the major imaging modality to study properties of white matter and the geometry of fiber tracts of the human brain. Clinical studies mostly focus on regional statistics of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) derived from tensors. Existing analysis techniques do not sufficiently take into account that the measurements are tensors, and thus require proper interpolation and statistics of tensors, and that regions of interest are fiber tracts with complex spatial geometry. We propose a new framework for quantitative tract-oriented DTI analysis that systematically includes tensor interpolation and averaging, using nonlinear Riemannian symmetric space. A new measure of tensor anisotropy, called geodesic anisotropy (GA) is applied and compared with FA. As a result, tracts of interest are represented by the geometry of the medial spine attributed with tensor statistics (average and variance) calculated within cross-sections. Feasibility of our approach is demonstrated on various fiber tracts of a single data set. A validation study, based on six repeated scans of the same subject, assesses the reproducibility of this new DTI data analysis framework.},

abstract = {Since the introduction of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) as a method for examining neural connectivity, its accuracy has not been formally evaluated. In this study, we directly compared connections that were visualized using injected neural tract tracers (WGA-HRP) with those obtained using in-vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. First, we injected the tracer at multiple sites in the brain of a macaque monkey; second, we reconstructed the histological sections of the labeled fiber tracts in 3D; third, we segmented and registered the fibers (somatosensory and motor tracts) with the anatomical in-vivo MRI from the same animal; and last, we conducted fiber tracing along the same pathways on the DTI data using a classical diffusion tracing technique with the injection sites as seeds. To evaluate the performance of DTI fiber tracing, we compared the fibers derived from the DTI tractography with those segmented from the histology. We also studied the influence of the parameters controlling the tractography by comparing Dice superimposition coefficients between histology and DTI segmentations. While there was generally good visual agreement between the two methods, our quantitative comparisons reveal certain limitations of DTI tractography, particularly for regions at remote locations from seeds. We have thus demonstrated the importance of appropriate settings for realistic tractography results.},

Using the capability of MR diffusion tensor imaging to determine the local orientations of neuronal fibers, novel algorithms were developed to bundle neuronal fiber pathways reconstructed in vivo with diffusion tensor images and to quantify various physical and geometric properties of fiber bundles. The reliability of the algorithms was examined with reproducibility tests. Illustrative results show that consistent physical and geometric measurements of novel properties of neuronal tissue can be obtained, which offer considerable potential for the quantitative study of fiber pathways in vivo.},

@article{Dougherty2005,
abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tracking (FT) were used to measure the occipital lobe fiber tracts connecting the two hemispheres in individual human subjects. These tracts are important for normal vision. Also, damage to portions of these tracts is associated with alexia. To assess the reliability of the DTI-FT measurements, occipital-callosal projections were estimated from each subject's left and right hemispheres independently. The left and right estimates converged onto the same positions within the splenium. We further characterized the properties of the estimated occipital-callosal fiber tracts by combining them with functional MRI. We used functional MRI to identify visual field maps in cortex and labeled fibers by the cortical functional response at the fiber endpoint. This labeling reveals a regular organization of the fibers within the splenium. The dorsal visual maps (dorsal V3, V3A, V3B, V7) send projections through a large band in the middle of the splenium, whereas ventral visual maps (ventral V3, V4) send projections through the inferior-anterior corner of the splenium. The agreement between the independent left/right estimates, further supported by previous descriptions of homologous tracts in macaque, validates the DTI-FT methods. However, a principal limitation of these methods is low sensitivity: a large number of fiber tracts that connect homotopic regions of ventral and lateral visual cortex were undetected. We conclude that most of the estimated tracts are real and can be localized with a precision of 1-2 mm, but many tracts are missed because of data and algorithm limitations.},

In this respect, modeling fiber bundles as currents seems particularly relevant, as it gives a metric between bundles which relies neither on point nor on fiber correspondences and which is robust to fiber interruption. First, this metric is included in a diffeomorphic registration scheme which consistently aligns sets of fiber bundles. In particular, we show that aligning directly fiber bundles may solve the aperture problem which appears when fiber mappings are constrained by tensors only. Second, the measure of variability of a population of fiber bundles is based on a statistical model which considers every bundle as a random diffeomorphic deformation of a common template plus a random non-diffeomorphic perturbation. Thus, the variability is decomposed into a geometrical part and a "texture" part. Our results on real data show that both parts may contain interesting anatomical features.},

abstract = {A novel method is proposed for performing multilabel, interactive image segmentation. Given a small number of pixels with user-defined (or predefined) labels, one can analytically and quickly determine the probability that a random walker starting at each unlabeled pixel will first reach one of the prelabeled pixels. By assigning each pixel to the label for which the greatest probability is calculated, a high-quality image segmentation may be obtained. Theoretical properties of this algorithm are developed along with the corresponding connections to discrete potential theory and electrical circuits. This algorithm is formulated in discrete space (i.e., on a graph) using combinatorial analogues of standard operators and principles from continuous potential theory, allowing it to be applied in arbitrary dimension on arbitrary graphs.},

abstract = {This paper describes a general and flexible Monte- Carlo simulation framework for diffusing spins that generates realistic synthetic data for diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Similar systems in the literature consider only simple substrates and their authors do not consider convergence and parameter optimization. We show how to run Monte-Carlo simulations within complex irregular substrates. We compare the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation to an analytical model of restricted diffusion to assess precision and accuracy of the generated results. We obtain an optimal combination of spins and updates for a given run time by trading off number of updates in favor of number of spins such that precision and accuracy of sythesized data are both optimized. Further experiments demonstrate the system using a tissue environment that current analytic models cannot capture. This tissue model incorporates swelling, abutting, and deformation. Swelling-induced restriction in the extracellular space due to the effects of abutting cylinders leads to large departures from the predictions of the analytical model, which does not capture these effects. This swelling-induced restriction may be an important mechanism in explaining the changes in apparent diffusion constant observed in the aftermath of acute ischemic stroke.},

To this end, we create standard streamtube models along with two two-dimensional representations, an embedding in the plane and a hierarchical clustering tree, for a given set of fiber tracts. We then link these three representations using both interaction and color obtained by embedding fiber tracts into a perceptually uniform color space. We describe an anecdotal evaluation with neuroscientists to assess the usefulness of our method in exploring anatomical and functional structures in the brain. Expert feedback indicates that, while a standalone clinical use of the proposed method would require anatomical landmarks in the lower dimensional representations, the approach would be particularly useful in accelerating tract bundle selection. Results also suggest that combining traditional 3D model viewing with lower dimensional representations can ease navigation through the complex fiber tract models, improving exploration of the connectivity in the brain.},

abstract = {We present a new five-dimensional (5-D) space representation of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) of high angular resolution. This 5-D space is basically a non-Euclidean space of position and orientation in which crossing fiber tracts can be clearly disentangled, that cannot be separated in three-dimensional position space. This new representation provides many possibilities for processing and analysis since classical methods for scalar images can be extended to higher dimensions even if the spaces are not Euclidean. In this paper, we show examples of how regularization and segmentation of dMRI is simplified with this new representation. The regularization is used with the purpose of denoising and but also to facilitate the segmentation task by using several scales, each scale representing a different level of resolution. We implement in five dimensions the Chan-Vese method combined with active contours without edges for the segmentation and the total variation functional for the regularization. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of segmenting white matter structures directly as entirely separated bundles in this 5-D space. We will present results from a synthetic model and results on real data of a human brain acquired with diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), one of the dMRI of high angular resolution available. These results will lead us to the conclusion that this new high-dimensional representation indeed simplifies the problem of segmentation and regularization.},

First, an algorithm is presented that minimizes the bias inherent in making measurements with a fixed set of gradient vector directions by spreading out measurements in 3-dimensional gradient vector space. Next, it is shown how the set of b-matrices and echo time can be optimized for estimating the diffusion tensor and its scalar invariants. The standard deviation in the estimate of the tensor trace in a water phantom was reduced by more than 40\% and the artefactual anisotropy was reduced by more than 60\% when using the optimized scheme compared with a more conventional scheme for the same scan time, and marked improvements are demonstrated in the human brain with the optimized sequences. Use of these optimal schemes results in reduced scan times, increased precision, or improved resolution in diffusion tensor images. Magn Reson Med 42:515-525, 1999.},

However, the voxel-based group-mapping and region-of-interest (ROI) approaches used to analyse the data have inherent conceptual and practical difficulties. Taking the example of the genu of the corpus callosum in a sample of schizophrenic patients, we discuss the difficulties in attempting to replicate a voxel-based finding of reduced anisotropy using two ROI methods. Firstly we consider conventional ROIs; secondly, we present a novel tractography-based approach. The problems of both methods are explored, particularly of high variance and ROI definition. The potential benefits of the tractographic method for neuropsychiatric conditions with subtle and diffuse pathology are outlined.},

abstract = {Geometric models of white matter architecture play an increasing role in neuroscientific applications of diffusion tensor imaging, and the most popular method for building them is fiber tractography. For some analysis tasks, however, a compelling alternative may be found in the first and second derivatives of diffusion anisotropy. We extend to tensor fields the notion from classical computer vision of ridges and valleys, and define anisotropy creases as features of locally extremal tensor anisotropy. Mathematically, these are the loci where the gradient of anisotropy is orthogonal to one or more eigenvectors of its Hessian. We propose that anisotropy creases provide a basis for extracting a skeleton of the major white matter pathways, in that ridges of anisotropy coincide with interiors of fiber tracts, and valleys of anisotropy coincide with the interfaces between adjacent but distinctly oriented tracts. The crease extraction algorithm we present generates high-quality polygonal models of crease surfaces, which are further simplified by connected-component analysis. We demonstrate anisotropy creases on measured diffusion MRI data, and visualize them in combination with tractography to confirm their anatomic relevance.},

The approach involves the use of a set a spatial patterns which are common to recorded and 'normal' EEGs and which can account for maximally different proportions of the combined variances in both EEGs. These spatial factors are used to decompose the EEG into orthogonal temporal wave forms which can be judged by the expert electroencephalographer to be abnormal, normal or of artifactual origin. The original EEG is then reconstructed using only the abnormal components and principal component analysis is used to present the spatial topography of the abnormal components. The effectiveness of the method is discussed along with its value for localization of abnormal sources. It is suggested, in conclusion, that the approach described may be optimal for interpretation of the clinical EEG since it allows what is best in terms of quantitative analysis of the EEG to be combined with the best that is available in terms of expert qualitative analysis.},

abstract = {A method is described which seems to be effective for extracting the abnormal components from the clinical EEG. The approach involves the use of a set a spatial patterns which are common to recorded and 'normal' EEGs and which can account for maximally different proportions of the combined variances in both EEGs. These spatial factors are used to decompose the EEG into orthogonal temporal wave forms which can be judged by the expert electroencephalographer to be abnormal, normal or of artifactual origin. The original EEG is then reconstructed using only the abnormal components and principal component analysis is used to present the spatial topography of the abnormal components. The effectiveness of the method is discussed along with its value for localization of abnormal sources. It is suggested, in conclusion, that the approach described may be optimal for interpretation of the clinical EEG since it allows what is best in terms of quantitative analysis of the EEG to be combined with the best that is available in terms of expert qualitative analysis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The spatio-temporal decomposition (STD) approach was used to localize the sources of simulated electroencephalograms (EEGs) to gain experience with the approach for analyzing real data. METHODS: The STD approach used is similar to the multiple signal classification method (MUSIC) in that it requires the signal subspace containing the sources of interest to be isolated in the EEG measurement space. It is different from MUSIC in that it allows more general methods of spatio-temporal decomposition to be used that may be better suited to the background EEG. RESULTS: If the EEG data matrix is not corrupted by noise, the STD approach can be used to locate multiple dipole sources of the EEG one at a time without a priori knowledge of the number of active sources in the signal space. In addition, the common-spatial-patterns method of spatio-temporal decomposition is superior to the eigenvector decomposition for localizing activity that is ictal in nature. CONCLUSIONS: The STD approach appears to be able to provide a means of localizing the equivalent dipole sources of realistic brain sources and that, even under difficult noise conditions and only 2 or 3 s of available EEG, the precision of the localization can be as low as a few mm.},

abstract = {Impairments in certain cognitive functions, such as working memory, are core features of schizophrenia. Convergent findings indicate that a deficiency in signalling through the TrkB neurotrophin receptor leads to reduced GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) synthesis in the parvalbumin-containing subpopulation of inhibitory GABA neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia. Despite both pre- and postsynaptic compensatory responses, the resulting alteration in perisomatic inhibition of pyramidal neurons contributes to a diminished capacity for the gamma-frequency synchronized neuronal activity that is required for working memory function. These findings reveal specific targets for therapeutic interventions to improve cognitive function in individuals with schizophrenia.},

abstract = {A family of methods aiming at the reconstruction of a putative fascicle map from any diffusion-weighted dataset is proposed. This fascicle map is defined as a trade-off between local information on voxel microstructure provided by diffusion data and a priori information on the low curvature of plausible fascicles. The optimal fascicle map is the minimum energy configuration of a simulated spin glass in which each spin represents a fascicle piece. This spin glass is embedded into a simulated magnetic external field that tends to align the spins along the more probable fiber orientations according to diffusion models. A model of spin interactions related to the curvature of the underlying fascicles introduces a low bending potential constraint. Hence, the optimal configuration is a trade-off between these two kind of forces acting on the spins. Experimental results are presented for the simplest spin glass model made up of compass needles located in the center of each voxel of a tensor based acquisition.},

An array of image-processing techniques has to be developed to turn DTI tractography into a practically useful tool. To this end, we have developed a suite of image-processing tools for fiber tractography with improved reliability. This article summarizes the main technical developments we have made to date, which include anisotropic smoothing, anisotropic interpolation, Bayesian fiber tracking and automatic fiber bundling. A primary focus of these techniques is the robustness to noise and partial volume averaging, the two major hurdles to reliable fiber tractography. Performance of these techniques has been comprehensively examined with simulated and in vivo DTI data, demonstrating improvements in the robustness and reliability of DTI tractography.},

We propose a new approach, which we termed real-time interactive fiber tracking, which aims at providing a rich and intuitive environment for the neuroradiologist. In this approach, fiber tracking is executed automatically every time the user acts upon the application. Particularly, when the volume of interest from which fiber trajectories are calculated is moved on the screen, fiber tracking is executed, even while it is being moved. We present our fiber tracking tool, which implements the real-time fiber tracking concept by using the video card's graphics processing units to execute the fiber tracking algorithm. Results show that real-time interactive fiber tracking is feasible on computers equipped with common, low-cost video cards.},

abstract = {Humans appear to have an inherent prosocial tendency toward one another in that we often take pleasure in seeing others succeed. This fact is almost certainly exploited by game shows, yet why watching others win elicits a pleasurable vicarious rewarding feeling in the absence of personal economic gain is unclear. One explanation is that game shows use contestants who have similarities to the viewing population, thereby kindling kin-motivated responses (for example, prosocial behavior). Using a game show-inspired paradigm, we show that the interactions between the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex subserve the modulation of vicarious reward by similarity, respectively. Our results support studies showing that similarity acts as a proximate neurobiological mechanism where prosocial behavior extends to unrelated strangers.},

We propose to instead perform tract-based morphometry (TBM), or the statistical analysis of diffusion MRI data in an anatomical tract-based coordinate system. We present a method for automatic generation of white matter tract arc length parameterizations, based on learning a fiber bundle model from tractography from multiple subjects.

abstract = {We introduce an automatic method that we call tract-based morphometry, or TBM, for measurement and analysis of diffusion MRI data along white matter fiber tracts. Using subject-specific tractography bundle segmentations, we generate an arc length parameterization of the bundle with point correspondences across all fibers and all subjects, allowing tract-based measurement and analysis. In this paper we present a quantitative comparison of fiber coordinate systems from the literature and we introduce an improved optimal match method that reduces spatial distortion and improves intra- and inter-subject variability of FA measurements. We propose a method for generating arc length correspondences across hemispheres, enabling a TBM study of interhemispheric diffusion asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and cingulum bundle (CB). The results of this study demonstrate that TBM can detect differences that may not be found by measuring means of scalar invariants in entire tracts, such as the mean diffusivity (MD) differences found in AF. We report TBM results of higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left hemisphere in AF (caused primarily by lower lambda(3), the smallest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the left AF), and higher left hemisphere FA in CB (related to higher lambda(1), the largest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the left CB). By mapping the significance levels onto the tractography trajectories for each structure, we demonstrate the anatomical locations of the interhemispheric differences. The TBM approach brings analysis of DTI data into the clinically and neuroanatomically relevant framework of the tract anatomy.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the use of color to represent the directional information contained in the diffusion tensor. Ideally, one wants to take into account both the properties of human color vision and of the given display hardware to produce a representation in which differences in the orientation of anisotropic structures are proportional to the perceived differences in color. It is argued here that such a goal cannot be achieved in general and therefore, empirical or heuristic schemes, which avoid some of the common artifacts of previously proposed approaches, are implemented. Directionally encoded color (DEC) maps of the human brain obtained using these schemes clearly show the main association, projection, and commissural white matter pathways. In the brainstem, motor and sensory pathways are easily identified and can be differentiated from the transverse pontine fibers and the cerebellar peduncles. DEC maps obtained from diffusion tensor imaging data provide a simple and effective way to visualize fiber direction, useful for investigating the structural anatomy of different organs.

abstract = {This study has investigated the relationship between the noise sensitivity of measurement by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the diffusion tensor (D) of water and the number N of diffusion-weighting (DW) gradient directions, using computer simulations of strongly anisotropic fibers with variable orientation. The DW directions uniformly sampled the diffusion ellipsoid surface. It is shown that the variation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of three ideally rotationally invariant scalars of D due to variable fiber orientation provides an objective quantitative measure for the diffusion ellipsoid sampling efficiency, which is independent of the SNR value of the baseline signal obtained without DW; the SNR variation decreased asymptotically with increasing N. The minimum number N(0) of DW directions, which minimized the SNR variation of the three scalars of D was determined, thereby achieving the most efficient ellipsoid sampling. The resulting time efficient diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocols provide robust estimation of diffusion anisotropy in the presence of noise and can improve the repeatability/reliability of DTI experiments when there is high variability in the orientation of similar anisotropic structures, as for example, in studies which require repeated measurement of one individual, intersubject comparisons or multicenter studies.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The commonly used streamline approach is adapted to exploit the uncertainty in the orientation of the principal direction of diffusion defined for each image voxel. Running the streamline process repeatedly using Monte Carlo methods to exploit this inherent uncertainty generates maps of connection probability. Uncertainty is defined by interpreting the shape of the diffusion orientation profile provided by the diffusion tensor in terms of the underlying microstructure. RESULTS: Two candidates for describing the uncertainty in the diffusion tensor are proposed and maps of probability of connection to chosen start points or regions are generated in a number of major tracts. CONCLUSION: The methods presented provide a generic framework for utilizing streamline methods to generate probabilistic maps of connectivity.},

abstract = {This paper exploits the idea that each individual brain region has a specific connection profile to create parcellations of the cortical mantle using MR diffusion imaging. The parcellation is performed in two steps. First, the cortical mantle is split at a macroscopic level into 36 large gyri using a sulcus recognition system. Then, for each voxel of the cortex, a connection profile is computed using a probabilistic tractography framework. The tractography is performed from q fields using regularized particle trajectories. Fiber ODF are inferred from the q-balls using a sharpening process focusing the weight around the q-ball local maxima. A sophisticated mask of propagation computed from a T1-weighted image perfectly aligned with the diffusion data prevents the particles from crossing the cortical folds. During propagation, the particles father child particles in order to improve the sampling of the long fascicles. For each voxel, intersection of the particle trajectories with the gyri lead to a connectivity profile made up of only 36 connection strengths. These profiles are clustered on a gyrus by gyrus basis using a K-means approach including spatial regularization. The reproducibility of the results is studied for three subjects using spatial normalization.},

abstract = {An inherent drawback of the traditional diffusion tensor model is its limited ability to provide detailed information about multidirectional fiber architecture within a voxel. This leads to erroneous fiber tractography results in locations where fiber bundles cross each other. This may lead to the inability to visualize clinically important tracts such as the lateral projections of the corticospinal tract. In this report, we present a deterministic two-tensor eXtended Streamline Tractography (XST) technique, which successfully traces through regions of crossing fibers. We evaluated the method on simulated and in vivo human brain data, comparing the results with the traditional single-tensor and with a probabilistic tractography technique. By tracing the corticospinal tract and correlating with fMRI-determined motor cortex in both healthy subjects and patients with brain tumors, we demonstrate that two-tensor deterministic streamline tractography can accurately identify fiber bundles consistent with anatomy and previously not detected by conventional single-tensor tractography. When compared to the dense connectivity maps generated by probabilistic tractography, the method is computationally efficient and generates discrete geometric pathways that are simple to visualize and clinically useful. Detection of crossing white matter pathways can improve neurosurgical visualization of functionally relevant white matter areas.},

These images, acquired by measuring the attenuation of NMR signal due to directionally dependent diffusion, have recently been shown to be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of acute stroke and in mapping of tissue structure. This work presents an improvement on the spin-echo (SE) diffusion sequence that displays less distortion and consequently improves image quality. Adding a second refocusing pulse provides better image quality with less distortion at no cost in scanning efficiency or effectiveness, and allows more flexible diffusion gradient timing. By adjusting the timing of the diffusion gradients, eddy currents with a single exponential decay constant can be nulled, and eddy currents with similar decay constants can be greatly reduced. This new sequence is demonstrated in phantom measurements and in diffusion anisotropy images of normal human brain.},

abstract = {Whereas high angular resolution reconstruction methods for diffusion MRI can estimate multiple dominant fibre orientations within a single imaging voxel, they are fundamentally limited in certain cases of complex subvoxel fibre structures, resulting in ambiguous local orientation distribution functions. In this article we address the important problem of disambiguating such complex subvoxel fibre tract configurations, with the purpose of improving the performance of fibre tractography. We do so by extending a curve inference method to distinguish between the cases of curving and fanning fibre bundles using differential geometric estimates in a local neighbourhood. The key benefit of this method is the inference of curves, instead of only fibre orientations, to model the underlying fibre bundles. This in turn allows distinct fibre geometries that contain nearly identical sets of fibre orientations at a voxel, to be distinguished from one another. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the method to successfully label voxels into one of the above categories and improve the performance of a fibre-tracking algorithm.},

The reconstruction, segmentation and registration are best approached from the 3D representation of the data set. RESULTS: Here we present a platform-independent framework based on Java and Java 3D for accelerated rendering of biological images. Our framework is seamlessly integrated into ImageJ, a free image processing package with a vast collection of community-developed biological image analysis tools. Our framework enriches the ImageJ software libraries with methods that greatly reduce the complexity of developing image analysis tools in an interactive 3D visualization environment. In particular, we provide high-level access to volume rendering, volume editing, surface extraction, and image annotation. The ability to rely on a library that removes the low-level details enables concentrating software development efforts on the algorithm implementation parts. CONCLUSIONS: Our framework enables biomedical image software development to be built with 3D visualization capabilities with very little effort. We offer the source code and convenient binary packages along with extensive documentation at http://3dviewer.neurofly.de.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To (a) determine the optimal choice of a scalar metric of anisotropy and (b) determine by means of magnetic resonance imaging if changes in diffusion anisotropy occurred in acute human ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The full diffusion tensor over the entire brain was measured. To optimize the choice of a scalar anisotropy metric, the performances of scalar indices in simulated models and in a healthy volunteer were analyzed. The anisotropy, trace apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor in lesions and contralateral normal brain were compared in 50 patients with stroke. RESULTS: Changes in anisotropy in patients were quantified by using fractional anisotropy because it provided the best performance in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio as a function of signal-to-noise ratio in simulations. The anisotropy of ischemic white matter decreased (P = .01). Changes in anisotropy in ischemic gray matter were not significant (P = .63). The trace ADC decreased for ischemic gray matter and white matter (P < .001). The first and second eigenvalues decreased in both ischemic gray and ischemic white matter (P < .001). The third eigenvalue decreased in ischemic gray (P = .001) and white matter (P = .03). CONCLUSION: Gray matter is mildly anisotropic in normal and early ischemic states. However, early white matter ischemia is associated with not only changes in trace ADC values but also significant changes in the anisotropy, or shape, of the water self-diffusion tensor.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR images contain information about the orientation of brain white matter fibres that potentially can be used to study human brain connectivity in vivo using tractography techniques. Currently, the diffusion tensor model is widely used to extract fibre directions from DW-MRI data, but fails in regions containing multiple fibre orientations. The spherical deconvolution technique has recently been proposed to address this limitation. It provides an estimate of the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) by assuming the DW signal measured from any fibre bundle is adequately described by a single response function. However, the deconvolution is ill-conditioned and susceptible to noise contamination. This tends to introduce artefactual negative regions in the FOD, which are clearly physically impossible. In this study, the introduction of a constraint on such negative regions is proposed to improve the conditioning of the spherical deconvolution. This approach is shown to provide FOD estimates that are robust to noise whilst preserving angular resolution. The approach also permits the use of super-resolution, whereby more FOD parameters are estimated than were actually measured, improving the angular resolution of the results. The method provides much better defined fibre orientation estimates, and allows orientations to be resolved that are separated by smaller angles than previously possible. This should allow tractography algorithms to be designed that are able to track reliably through crossing fibre regions.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted imaging can potentially be used to infer the connectivity of the human brain in vivo using fibre-tracking techniques, and is therefore of great interest to neuroscientists and clinicians. A key requirement for fibre tracking is the accurate estimation of white matter fibre orientations within each imaging voxel. The diffusion tensor model, which is widely used for this purpose, has been shown to be inadequate in crossing fibre regions. A number of approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue, based on high angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (HARDI) data. In this study, an experimental model of crossing fibres, consisting of water-filled plastic capillaries, is used to thoroughly assess three such techniques: constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), super-resolved CSD (super-CSD) and Q-ball imaging (QBI). HARDI data were acquired over a range of crossing angles and b-values, from which fibre orientations were computed using each technique. All techniques were capable of resolving the two fibre populations down to a crossing angle of 45 degrees , and down to 30 degrees for super-CSD. A bias was observed in the fibre orientations estimated by QBI for crossing angles other than 90 degrees, consistent with previous simulation results. Finally, for a 45 degrees crossing, the minimum b-value required to resolve the fibre orientations was 4000 s/mm(2) for QBI, 2000 s/mm(2) for CSD, and 1000 s/mm(2) for super-CSD. The quality of estimation of fibre orientations may profoundly affect fibre tracking attempts, and the results presented provide important additional information regarding performance characteristics of well-known methods.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can resolve the white matter fiber orientation within a voxel provided that the fibers are strongly aligned. However, a given voxel may contain a distribution of fiber orientations due to, for example, intravoxel fiber crossing. The present study sought to test whether a geodesic, high b-value diffusion gradient sampling scheme could resolve multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. In regions of fiber crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient orientation, indicating the presence of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a gradient descent scheme. The multitensor reconstruction resolved multiple intravoxel fiber populations corresponding to known fiber anatomy. Magn Reson Med 48:577-582, 2002. � 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Signal matrices or covariance matrices are decomposed using spatial factors common to multiple conditions. The spatial factors and corresponding spatial filters are then dissociated into specific and common parts, according to the common spatial subspace which exists among the data sets. Finally, the specific signal components are extracted using the corresponding spatial filters and spatial factors. The relationship between this decomposition and spatio-temporal source models is described in this paper. Computer simulations suggest that this method can facilitate the analysis of brain responses under multiple task conditions and merits further application.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight healthy adults and 20 healthy neonates were examined with a 3.0-T head-only magnetic resonance (MR) imaging unit by using a single-shot diffusion-tensor sequence. Trace ADC maps, FA maps, directional maps of the putative directions of white matter (WM) tracts, and fiber-tracking maps were obtained. Regions of interest-eight in WM and one in gray matter (GM)-were predefined for the ADC and FA measurements. The Student t test was used to compare FA and ADC between adults and neonates, whereas the Tukey multiple-comparison test was used to compare FA and ADC in different brain regions in the adult and neonate groups. RESULTS: A global elevation in ADC (P <.001) in both GM and WM and a reduction in FA (P <.001) in WM were observed in neonates as compared with these values in adults. In addition, significant regional variations in FA and ADC were observed in both groups. Regional variations in FA and ADC were less remarkable in adults, whereas neonates had consistently higher FA values and lower ADC values in the central WM as compared with these values in the peripheral WM. Fiber tracking revealed only major WM tracts in the neonates but fibers extending to the peripheral WM in the adults. CONCLUSION: There were regional differences in FA and ADC values in the neonates; such variations were less remarkable in the adults.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a robust approach to the registration of white matter tractographies extracted from diffusion tensor-magnetic resonance imaging scans. The fibers are projected into a high dimensional feature space based on the sequence of their 3-D coordinates. Adaptive mean-shift clustering is applied to extract a compact set of representative fiber-modes (FM). Each FM is assigned to a multivariate Gaussian distribution according to its population thereby leading to a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) representation for the entire set of fibers. The registration between two fiber sets is treated as the alignment of two GMMs and is performed by maximizing their correlation ratio. A nine-parameters affine transform is recovered and eventually refined to a twelve-parameters affine transform using an innovative mean-shift based registration refinement scheme presented in this paper. The validation of the algorithm on synthetic intrasubject data demonstrates its robustness to interrupted and deviating fiber artifacts as well as outliers. Using real intrasubject data, a comparison is conducted to other intensity based and fiber-based registration algorithms, demonstrating competitive results. An option for tracking-in-time, on specific white matter fiber tracts, is also demonstrated on the real data.},
