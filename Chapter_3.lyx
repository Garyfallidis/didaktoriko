 years ago a great number of methods have been published.
 Often these algorithms depend strictly on the underlying voxel model or
 acquisition paradigm making it difficult for other researchers to apply
 their own reconstruction methods and evaluate their data sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work we designed a purely deterministic method which is fast, accurate
 and all-inclusive.
 Most importantly it can have as input model-based or model-free reconstruction
 algorithms of most known algorithms.
 We call this algorithm EuDX.
 Eu stands for Euler integration, D stands for Delta function which is a
 function that checks for many different stopping criteria and X stands
 for fibre crossings.
 EuDX can deal with any number of crossing fibres as long as the reconstruction
 algorithm supports them.
 The purpose of this algorithm is to be faithful to the reconstruction results
 rather than try to correct or enhance them by introducing regional or global
 considerations which is the topic of other methods reviewed below.
 Therefore, EuDX serves mainly as a robust method for quickly inspecting
 different reconstruction results using streamlines.
 EuDX is noise-friendly i.e.
 if a voxel is too noisy then EuDX will stop tracking on that voxel.
 This property is often useful when validating underlying reconstruction
 models.
 Branching is also supported by a combination of trilinear interpolation
 and propagation along multiple peaks per voxel.
 This method is an extension of the method used by Conturo et al.

, can be grouped in three categories: a) local, b) global and c) simulated.
 Local approaches propagate a curve from a starting (seed) point using locally
 greedy criteria, i.e.
 tracking sequentially through orientation estimates in adjacent voxels.
 Global approaches identify the best path between two points of interest,
 according to some optimization criterion, rather than identifying paths
 arising from a single point.
 Simulated approaches comprise of algorithms that simulate the diffusion
 process or solve the diffusion equation to reconstruct white matter tracks.
 A detailed literature review is given below.

 Deterministic approaches usually stop propagating when a low anisotropy
 region (usually FA < 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2$
\end_inset

) is found.
 This is useful in order to avoid propagation within the CSF where anatomical
 tracts do not exist or within deep gray matter regions where tracking is
 uncertain.
 They usually also check for large angular changes (e.g.
 larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $90{}^{\circ}$

) between successive steps to avoid unrealistically sharp turns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Deterministic methods can also be utilized when multiple orientations are
 estimated in a single voxel (crossing fibres).
 These orientations can for example be obtained as the principal eigenvectors
 of multiple Tensors fitted to the data

 There are different approaches for propagating across voxels where more
 than one fibre orientation has been identified.
 One approach is, upon entering a voxel, to choose the orientation that
 produces the smallest curvature with the incoming path used in Wedeen et

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Streamline tractography utilizes only the fibre orientation estimates.
 In general, more information is available upon post-processing ofDWimages.
 For example, with DTI a diffusion tensor is computed.
 For perfectly spherical tensors the deflection angle is zero, while for
 oblate tensors, the deflection is towards the ellip- soid plane.
 Tensor deflection tractography is less sensitive to noise than streamline,
 as shown in simulations for straight tracts (Lazar et al., 2003).
 It can also propagate through regions of perpendicular fibre crossings,
 where the principal eigenvector of the underlying oblate Tensor is meaningless.
 However, Tensor deflection underestimates curvature for curved tracts.
 Furthermore, TEND results should be interpreted carefully, as an incoming
 direction that coincides with any of the Tensor eigenvectors will not be
 deflected by that Tensor; even if it is perpendicular to the principal
 eigenvector of a highly prolate Tensor (Lazar et al., 2003).
 All the methods presented in this section are deterministic and provide
 binary connectivity information.
 A voxel B can be either connected or not connected to the seed S, depending
 on whether a streamline from S passes through B.
 To tackle this issue, a group of probabilistic tractography approaches
 have been developed and these are presented in the following section.

 shares the problems of the other deterministic algorithms by failing in
 relatively sharp turns and Meyer's Loop.
 Furthermore, because these methods need a continuous field this necessitates
 the use of interpolation e.g.
 nearest, bicubic or trilinear.
 The amount and type of interpolation is another factor that can change
 dramatically the results of tractography and it is very rarely reported.

 Here the standard procedure is to calculate a spatial distribution of tracks
 arising from a single seed rather than a single track.
 In each propagation step of each streamline, a random perturbation of the
 underlying fibre orientation estimate is followed.
 Perturbations are generated using functions that characterize the uncertainty
 in the fibre orientation within each voxel.
 A probabilistic index of connectivity (PICo) is defined between a seed
 and an arbitrary point as 
\begin_inset Formula $M/N$
\end_inset

 ; where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of all the tracks that start from the seed and

 are two of the first to apply this method in dMRI.
 This is a non-parametric approach where a diffusion acquisition is repeated
 many times creating a large set of images for the same subject.
 Some images from this set are drawn in random with replacement.
 This process gives a single bootstrap sample.
 Drawing many samples will give a distribution for the fibre orientation.
 The advantage of bootstrap tractography is that no ad-hoc assumptions are
 made on the noise and it is sensitive to all sources of variability that
 affect the acquired data set.
 The disadvantage is that many repeated acquisitions are required; at least

 Another limitation is that it is still sensitive to local noise.
 Global approaches try to overcome these limitations by being distance-independe
nt and by increasing resistance against noise in a global fashion.
 These are achieved by finding an optimal path between two voxels, according

Front evolution

techniques often employ fast marching techniques.
 The front expands from the seed neighbours to the next neighbouring nodes
 with speeds determined by the local fibre orientations.
 As the front propagates, a time of front arrival can be associated with
 each visited voxel.
 Once all image voxels have been traversed by the front, paths of connection
 can be obtained going backwards in the map of front arrival times.
 Starting from an arbitrary voxel, a gradient descent algorithm can find
 the fastest route back to the seed.
 A connectivity index can be associated with each path, representing either
 the weakest link along the path or the agreement between the path tangents
 and the underlying vector orientation field (see Parker et al.

 The common concept of these approaches is that each image voxel becomes
 a node in the graph where the edges of the graph connect pairs of neighbouring
 voxels or ROIs.
 The edges are assigned weights that can be representative of any type of
 structural information.
 Anatomical paths are then defined as chains with successive elements being
 neighbouring voxels.
 The weights of the edges are used to determine the path strength.
 The strongest path between any image voxel and a seed can then be identified
 using algorithms that search efficiently the image graph.

 This is achieved by minimizing the overall energy of all cylinders simultaneous

 the polymerization process which is a process of interacting monomer molecules

 a ground truth from anatomical studies, digital or hardware phantoms is

 Our concentration was to create a more general tractography algorithm which
 can be used with very different families of anistropic functions and work
 well with multiple crossing fibres.
 This algorithm which we call EuDX is applied usually in native space image
 coordinates and it assumes that the voxel dimensions are equal in all three
 dimensions i.e.
 it assumes equal voxel size in all three dimensions.
 If the provided data do not have isotropic voxel size then a reslicing
 preprocessing step to isotropic is required.

In order to create tracks we need to provide initially one or more seed
 points 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 These can be chosen randomly or we can specify them explicitly.
 However, these seed points need to be constrained by the volume's dimensions.
 Every seed point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{p}_{0}$
\end_inset

 becomes the starting point for the track propagation.
 For the integration we solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{p}_{t}=\mathbf{p}_{0}+\int_{0}^{t}\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{s}))d\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 and we perform the integration numerically using Euler's method
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{p}_{n+1}=\mathbf{p}_{n}+\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{p}_{n})\Delta s\label{eq: euler}\end{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta s$
\end_inset

 is the propagation step size which should be at least smaller than the
 voxel size and

 Alternatively, Runge-Kutta of 
\begin_inset Formula $2$

th order could be used.
 However, in this document we only experimented with Euler's method.

In every voxel centre (black dot) there an one or more vectors.
 These vectors represent peaks where their length is equal to their anisotropy
 value and the direction is equal to the direction of the peak e.g.
 calculated from a given ODF.
 EuDX can track multiple peaks starting from a single seed point (star)
 if their anisotropy values are higher than a threshold.
 In that way we can track from the same seed towards different directions
 and support tracking in crossing areas as it is shown here.

For EuDX's stopping criteria we can use a standard scalar function like
 FA but we can also use vector functions like Quantitative Anisotropy (QA)
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 or even the full Orientation Density Function (ODF)
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "aganj2010reconstruction"

\end_inset

.
 The only constraint for these functions is to be greater or equal to zero
 everywhere in the volume.
 In most cases, all these functions try to measure in some way the anisotropy
 of diffusion in every single voxel so we decided to use the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 for the purpose of representing all these different functions applied on
 the image grid.
 Therefore, when we write 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{u}_{i})=\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 this reads for the peak unit direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

 the peak value was 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 For the simple case of FA, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is equal with the eigenvector corresponding to the highest eigenvalue,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{e})=FA$
\end_inset

.
 For QA which can allow for any number of peaks, where usually we constrain
 it to maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

, we use 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{u}_{i})=QA_{i}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in[1,3]$
\end_inset

 denotes the current peak.
 The peak can be characterised by two things: (a) the anisotropy value 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 and (b) the unit direction of the peak 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The concept of tracking with the combination of multiple peaks is presented
 in Fig.

.
 In order to reduce storing space, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 can be replaced by an index to the closest vertex of an evenly distributed
 and dense unit sphere.
 For generality and simplicity we require this indexing process even for
 the case of the Single Tensor where the peak direction is only one.
 Alternatively, we can see this process as a strategy which always maps
 any representation of the voxel on the sphere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The EuDX algorithm can be described further in the following way: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{u}_{i})$
\end_inset

 is estimated at every point of the volume.
 This represents a composite vector field where every point contains the
 peak directions superimposed to the anisotropy values.
 We create an empty list of tracks 
\begin_inset Formula $T=\emptyset$
\end_inset

 and then we generate random or prespecified seed points.
 In more detail: we select a seed point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{p}_{0}$
\end_inset

 and start propagating.
 We need to remember that the propagation direction can go forward and backward,
 or better said towards one direction (orthograde) and its opposite direction
 (retrograde).
 For the moment we only propagate towards one direction set by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{p}_{0})=\argmax_{\mathbf{u}}\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{u})\label{eq:argmax_anisotropy}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
noindent
\end_layout

\end_inset

 but we need to remember to propagate also towards the opposite direction
 
\begin_inset Formula $-\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{p}_{0})$
\end_inset

.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 can have multiple values in each voxel (representing different peaks) we
 need to remember that when we finish with this track followed by direction
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 we will need to propagate towards the direction of second peak, third peak
 etc.
 This is necessary if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 gives information for multiple peaks as it is common with QA (see section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Quantitative-Anisotropy"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the direction, we also need to check when to stop tracking.
 EuDX takes as input a threshold for anisotropy 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{thr}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{p}_{n})<\mathcal{A}_{thr}$
\end_inset

 then EuDX stops propagating.
 Otherwise it appends the point to the current track.
 This can be useful for canceling out any seed points which are in the backgroun
d or in very low anisotropy areas where tracking is not recommended e.g.
 in the CSF.
 One important point here is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{thr}$
\end_inset

 depends on the reconstruction method and it will have a different value
 for every different metric QA, FA, GFA etc.
 Therefore, we expect EuDX to give different results with different 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to generate a smooth tractography it is recommended to use some
 kind of interpolation; this is in contrast with FACT which does not use
 neighbouring information.
 Here we have been using trilinear interpolation which works in the following
 way: the seed devides the neighbouring area (constrained by the centers
 of the neighbouring voxels) in 
\begin_inset Formula $8$
\end_inset

 regions in 3D (
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 in 2D) and the total contribution of the neighbouring points is added according
 to the weights 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 of the antipodal side.
 The weights express subvolumes in 3D (subareas in 2D).
 The trilinear interpolation give us the weights 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 that assign the contribution of the directions of the peaks of the neighbouring
 voxels to the seed's next direction.
 It is important to clarify at this point that trilinear interpolation is
 used only for interpolating the peak directions of the propagation and
 not the values of the peaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We describe here how we use the trilinear interpolation weights in order
 to find the next propagation direction.
 (a) We find the nearest direction from the seed's initial direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{p_{n}})$
\end_inset

 to every peak direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

 of every one of the 
\begin_inset Formula $8$
\end_inset

 corners of the neighbourhood of the seed.
 (b) If 
\begin_inset Formula $\textnormal{arccos}(\mathbf{x}_{i},\mathbf{p}_{n})\leqq\theta_{thr}$
\end_inset

 we count the corresponding weight; otherwise we continue to the next weight.
 We simultaneously check for the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{u})<\mathcal{A}_{thr}$
\end_inset

.
 (c) All the adjacent weights will contribute to the new direction according
 to the following formula
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}^{'}(\mathbf{p}_{n})=\sum_{m}w_{m}\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{p}_{m})\label{eq:trilinear_weights}\end{equation}

 is normalized.
 d) The next point is calculated with Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: euler"

\end_inset

.
 e) We insert the new point in the track and continue tracking until one
 of the stopping criteria is met.
 The next step will be to repeat the a-e steps for the opposite direction
 of the initial peak direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{p}_{o})$
\end_inset

 and for the smaller peaks as described above.
 Finally, we will have to repeat the procedure for the next seed point until
 all seed points are visited.
 When all seeds have been visited we will have in our hands the entire tractogra

Apart from the anisotropic threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{thr}$
\end_inset

 and angular threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{thr}$
\end_inset

 other anisotropic criteria are also incorporated in EuDX.
 These are: a) The total sum of weights 
\begin_inset Formula $TW$
\end_inset

, which checks there is enough overall neighbouring contribution to continue
 tracking (default value of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5$
\end_inset

).
 This is very useful in edges or corners where tracking should stop.
 b) It is possible for a track to get trapped in a loop and start looping
 for ever.
 We can check for that using a maximum length threshold or a threshold for
 maximum number of points describing a track 
\begin_inset Formula $MNP$
\end_inset

 (default maximum value 
\begin_inset Formula $1000$
\end_inset

 points).

 This is called for every seed and every peak.
 The algorithm starts by calling the function Initial_Direction which finds
 the closest peak direction to follow from the nearby voxels.
 If the values of these peaks are lower than 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{thr}$
\end_inset

 then it returns False otherwise it returns True and the vector with the
 initial direction.
 The variable delta is used as check point that no stopping criteria are
 met.
 As long as delta is True we can continue tracking using Euler integration
 (see Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The function New_Direction calculates the new direction of the propagation
 by accumulating the weights created by trilinear interpolation as shown
 in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and finds the nearest direction for the eight neighbouring voxels.
 It also checks for the total weight threshold

 After this is done we update the points as shown in Eq.

 and repeat the same procedure until one of the stopping criteria is met
 by checking variable delta.
 EuDX stems its D letter from that delta function.
 After tracking towards the orthograde direction has stopped and delta is
 now False, we repeat the same procedure as before for the retrograde direction
 in order to create the complete track (see Alg.

In order to validate the performance of EuDX we created a 3D software phantom
 with the method described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 using eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{\parallel}=1.7\times10^{-3}$

\begin_inset Formula $m^{2}/sec$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{\perp}=0.1\times10^{-3}m^{2}/sec$
\end_inset

 which are in the range typically found in the human brain 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "canalesrodriguez2009mdq"

\end_inset

.
 The software phantom consists of two parts: a) a diagonal orbit and b)
 an elliptical orbit with axes ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{\lambda_{2}}{\lambda_{1}}=0.6$
\end_inset

.
 Both parts were added together to create a crossing configuration and partial
 volume effects are assumed negligible.
 The average thickness of both parts was 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 voxels.
 The elliptical orbit did not complete a full ellipse in order to avoid
 creating looping tracks which have no anatomical relevance.
 We created two experiments using the same data set of size 
\begin_inset Formula $64\times64\times64\times102$
\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 first dimensions give the size of the volume and the last dimension is
 the number of diffusion weighted volumes (
\begin_inset Formula $101$
\end_inset

) plus 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

); therefore, DSI, GQI, EIT or DTI were all suitable for the signal reconstructi
on into ODFs or Tensors respectively for these type of data.
 In contrast, QBI is not suitable because it assumes a spherical grid in
 q-space (see section

 For both experiments we used a high SNR of 
\begin_inset Formula $100$

 as the main goal was to validate the algorithm on good conditions.
 We will discuss later the validation process with human data sets where
 SNR is naturally lower.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "Flo:crossing_eudx_sims"

\end_inset

) we generated 
\begin_inset Formula $200,000$
\end_inset

 uniformly sampled random seeds in the entire 3D volume of the phantom.
 We used DSI reconstruction with standard parameters: q-space grid size
 
\begin_inset Formula $16$
\end_inset

, hanning filter width 
\begin_inset Formula $32$
\end_inset

, and radial integration range from 
\begin_inset Formula $2.1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

 at steps of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2$
\end_inset

.
 As we presented earlier, EuDX expects as input the peaks and the directions
 of the peaks.
 For every voxel we used DSI to create the corresponding ODF (sampled on
 an evenly distributed sphere of 
\begin_inset Formula $642$
\end_inset

 vertices and 
\begin_inset Formula $1,280$
\end_inset

 faces) and from the ODF we used the peak finding function introduced in
 section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Peak-Finding"

\end_inset

.
 We further removed the peaks which had values less that 
\begin_inset Formula $70\%$
\end_inset

 of the highest peak and normalized the rest so that the maximum peak equals
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 From now on we will call this output function from the ODF; PK (PeaK anisotropy
).
 PK is different from QA because we do not remove the isotropic component
 neither we normalize with the overall maximum ODF value as it is common
 practice with QA (see section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Quantitative-Anisotropy"

\end_inset

).
 We also calculated FA and zeroed the peaks with FA values lower than 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2$
\end_inset

.
 In that way we ensured that there will be no tracking in the background
 area of the phantom.

.
 The tracks are colour-coded with their orientation; this is defined as
 the unit vector connecting the first with the last point of each track.
 Because we generated random seeds that went everywhere in the phantom some
 of them had to fall in the crossing area.
 In accordance with what we discussed in the previous section we know that
 if a seed falls in a crossing region, EuDX will propagate towards both
 directions of the crossing if and only if multiple peaks are supported
 from the underlying reconstruction method.
 We can confirm this by observing the result at Fig.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 We can see that the crossing area is well represented and that the propagation
 was successful.
 We can also observe that not all tracks travel the entire distance from
 end to end.
 Otherwise we would expect to see all tracks of the entire elliptic part
 with one colour and the tracks of the straight orbit all with a different
 colour because they have different orientation.
 It seems that this observation had something to do with the discrete nature
 of the phantom especially near the bundles' boundary areas and of course
 the functionality of EuDX.
 For this purpose, we created a different experiment to evaluate this finding.

 the reconstruction; the tracking started from A reached only C.
 However, when EITL was used the tracks reached both areas B and C as it
 was expected.

).
 More precisely, the end-point areas of the phantom denoted with A, B, C
 and D.
 The goal was to count the percentage of tracks which reached any of the
 other end-point areas.
 We tried this with 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 different reconstruction methods: Single Tensor, EITL, DSI and GQI.
 The Single Tensor was fitted using weighted least squares.
 For EITL we used for radial sampling from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 with steps of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.4$
\end_inset

 and Gaussian weighting of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.05$
\end_inset

.
 GQI had sampling length of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.2$
\end_inset

 and DSI had the same parameters as in the previous experiment.
 The orientations of the peaks for all the methods were found in a reconstructio
n sphere of 
\begin_inset Formula $642$
\end_inset

 vertices.
 The same peaking function was also used with the ODFs of EITL, GQI and
 DSI.
 For these 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 methods the peaking procedure was the same as described in the previous
 experiment.
 The single peak of the DTI reconstruction was found by the eigenvector
 corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue.
 EuDX expects the orientation input of the peaks as indices on a unit sphere.
 Therefore, for the Single Tensor case; for the eigenvector which corresponds
 to the maximum eigenvalue we found the vertex in the reconstruction sphere
 with the minimum angular distance.
 An alternative way would be to calculate the ODF directly from the Tensor
 in an analytical way.
 Then we could continue as we do with the other methods i.e.
 find the peaks in the ODF with our standard peak finding method.
 We did not follow this approach because theoretically the orientation of
 the peak of the Tensor ODF is identical with the direction of the eigenvector
 which corresponds to the maximum eigenvalue and the reconstruction sphere
 is densely sampled.

 A first general observation is that independently from which end-point
 ROIs the tracks start there will always be a percentage of tracks which
 will stop before reaching the other end-points.
 We can clearly see this phenomenon by observing the last column of each
 sub-table.
 The last column that we symbolize with 
\begin_inset Formula $\emptyset$
\end_inset

 holds the percentage of tracks which did not reach any of the other end-points
 e.g.
 tracks which started from seeds in region A never reached regions B, C
 or D.
 We can observe in these columns that the best case was 
\begin_inset Formula $3.7\%$
\end_inset

 loss from reconstructions using EITL and the worst case was 
\begin_inset Formula $43.5\%$
\end_inset

 loss using DTI.

\begin_inset Caption

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Every sub-table shows the percentage of tracks which started from areas
 A, B, C or D (rows) and reached the other areas A, B, C, D or 
\begin_inset Formula $\emptyset$
\end_inset

 (columns) using EuDX with input from different reconstruction methods DTI,
 EITL, DSI, GQI.
 The column 
\begin_inset Formula $\emptyset$
\end_inset

 symbolizes the number of tracks which did not reach any of the A, B, C,
 D areas.
 For example, by looking only the first row of each sub-table we easily
 observe that the crossing area was well represented by EITL, DSI and GQI
 but not from DTI as it was expected because the Single Tensor cannot resolve
 crossings.
 We can also observe by comparing all the rows that in the more curve branch
 AB of the phantom fewer tracks reached their target than in the diagonal
 branch CD.

So, why are there always a number of tracks which will not reach the other
 end-points? This happens because most of the area in high-dimensional volumes
 (3D volumes) is concentrated close to the boundaries of the volumes; therefore
 many random seeds will fall close to the boundaries.
 In addition, the boundaries are not smooth (see left panel of Fig.
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Flo:eudx_fromABCD"

\end_inset

) and for this reason the tracks which will start close to the boundaries
 will most likely not travel long distances and because the number of seeds
 which will fall close to the boundaries is not negligible; the number of
 tracks which will not travel far is not negligible as well.
 This is something to have in mind when generating tractographies.
 A naive solution would be to increase the resolution of the volume by interpola
tion.
 This approach has also its disadvantages; the diffusion data sets are already
 very large and increasing the resolution would result in a further increase.
 Interpolation on the other hand is usually associated with smoothing which
 will reduce the peak resolution in relation to high b-values where the
 signal is generally low.
 For this purpose we decided to not preprocess the phantom any further.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another general observation is that in the curved branch less tracks reached
 their target than in the diagonal branch.
 This is to be expected because the discretization is more asymmetric in
 the curved branch (see Fig.
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

-left panel) therefore, more tracks close to the boundaries will stop propagatin
g because they reach background voxels where anisotropy is much lower.
 This is in agreement with EuDX which is designed to stop in low anisotropic
 regions as defined by parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{thr}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the right panel of Fig.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

~
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Flo:eudx_fromABCD"

\end_inset

 we see that the tracks which started from ROI A, reached only ROI C when
 we used the peaks from the Single Tensor reconstruction as input to EuDX.
 However, when we used EITL the tracks which started from A, reached both
 B and C.
 The tracks did not reach ROI D because of the angular threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{thr}$
\end_inset

.
 In contrast, tracks which traveled from the right part of the bundle did
 reach ROI C.
 This happened because the trilinear interpolation close to the intersection
 area gave more weight to the directions of the neighbouring voxels and
 the diverting angle was less than 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{thr}$
\end_inset

.
 This was another confirmation about the behaviour of EuDX in crossing areas.
 This identified that even if the seeds have not fallen in the intersection
 region of the two bundles, the tracks which will reach the crossing region
 will follow the branch to which they are closer to in terms of spatial
 and angular distances.
 This is possible because of the usage of trilinear interpolation.

Independently from the deterministic tractography described previously we
 repeated the same experiments with probabilistic tracks generated from
 the Camino Diffusion MRI Toolkit

.
 We will call these PMT tracks where PMT stands for Probabilistic MultiTensor
 Tractography.
 In order to create the PMT tracks we fitted a Two Tensor model in the data
 with both Tensors enforced to be prolate.
 For the fitting method we used the standard non-linear fit provided in
 Camino with positivity constraints.
 For this purpose we used the command 
\begin_inset Formula $\texttt{modelfit\,-model\, cylcyl\, nldt\_pos}$
\end_inset

.
 The probabilistic tractography was generated using Pico PDFs sampled from
 a Watson distribution (
\begin_inset Formula $\texttt{picopdfs -pdf -watson}$
\end_inset

).
 In order to generate the streamlines we used the Camino command 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $\texttt{track}$

\emph default
 which took as input the PDFs from before and a seed file with the mask.

 anywhere in the simulated bundles and a second where the seeds were constrained

Results with humans

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we investigate how EuDX performed with real data sets.
 There are mainly two ways to validate tractographies with real data sets
 of healthy humans.
 The first is to directly ask for feedback from specialist neuroanatomists
 who have good understanding of the underlying white matter anatomy and
 the second is to compare against the results of another published tractography
 method which has already gone through anatomical validation from experts.
 We investigated both approaches.
 In order to do that we generated tractographies (see Fig.

B) and asked expert neuroanatomists Professor Luigi Cataneo and Dr.
 Nivedita Agarwal from the Center for Brain/Mind Science (CiMeC) in Trento,
 Italy to validate the quality of the data in relationship to their knowledge
 of anatomy.
 We then asked them to manually label bundles of their scientific interest
 in different subjects.

 we developed an interactive visualization application (available in

).
 This is based on a novel tractography clustering method which is the topic
 of the next chapter.
 This application has the capability to create an accessible representation
 of the initial tractography into bundles of interest (BOIs).
 In this concept, a bundle is a collection of tracks with similar spatial
 and shape characteristics.
 After the BOIs are created, the medical practitioners can select one or
 more BOIs interactively and hide the parts of the tractography which are
 not interesting to their investigations.
 This application is further explained in Chapter

The tractographies were generated in diffusion native space and then linearly
 registered in MNI space.
 For that reason FA volumes were generated from the same data sets using
 Tensor fitting with weighted least squares after skull stripping with FSL
 
\begin_inset Formula $\texttt{bet}$
\end_inset

.
 These FA volumes were again in diffusion native space, therefore we used
 FSL 
\begin_inset Formula $\texttt{flirt}$
\end_inset

 to align them in MNI space.
 For this purpose a standard FA atlas 
\begin_inset Formula $\texttt{FMRIB58}$

 We then applied the affine transformation matrix from the previous step
 to the initial tractography to align it to MNI space.

 of bundles, we linearly registered structural MRIs (T1 MPRAGE) images from
 the same subjects to the standard template

.
 Therefore, the tractography and the T1 image were registered in the same
 space.
 This was very useful for the neuroanatomists because they could find known
 bundles from the regions they connect in the cortex which are better visible
 in the T1 image rather than in the FA image.

) by generating tracks towards both directions of the crossings.
 We wanted to confirm if tracking in crossing areas was also robust with
 human data sets where the noise artefacts are less predictable.
 This was indeed confirmed by looking at the intersection of two well known
 bundles: the Body of Corpus Callosum (BCC) and the Corticospinal Tract
 (CST).

B we can see that a part from the BCC shown with red is intersecting the
 CST bundle shown with blue without being diverted from the CST.
 If EuDX was not able to propagate in crossing areas then the tracks from
 BCC would stop in the intersection area or divert towards the direction
 of the CST.

In the next experiment we visually compared specific bundles across different
 healthy subjects.
 We concentrated at a pair of bundles not so often studied in literature:
 the Cingulum bundles; across 
\begin_inset Formula $12$
\end_inset

 healthy subjects (
\begin_inset Formula $20-40$
\end_inset

 years old).
 The Cingulum (CG) is an association fibre tract that runs within the Cingulate
 Gyrus along its entire length.
 It collects axons from the Cingulate Gyrus that travel immediately dorsal
 to the Corpus Callosum (CC) and along the ventral face of the Hippocampus,
 forming a large C-shape trajectory.
 It carries afferent connections from the Cingulate Gyrus to the entorhinal
 cortex.
 Because of its narrow tubular shape, it is often difficult to reveal its
 entire length by a single data set 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 CG has the characteristic that both left and right CGs travel in parallel
 and are very close to each other.
 Often many tractography algorithms do not represent the Cingulum bundle
 very well because it is very close to the CC.
 However, using EuDX we see that both left and right CG bundles were consistent
 across all 
\begin_inset Formula $12$

 subjects (see Fig.

 The reconstruction parameters and EuDX parameters were the same as before

 We masked out all voxels with FA

 in order to make sure that seeding will take place in areas of high anisotropy.
 We then generated EuDX tracks using DTI, GQI, DSI and EITL reconstructions
 respectively.
 We also used the same seeds to generate probabilistic PMT tracks.
 In Fig.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 we can see that EuDX based tracks are more uniform than the PMT tracks.
 We can also observe that the DTI tracks do not represent well the SLF regions
 of the bundles especially on the left hemisphere.
 Finally, we can observe the GQI, DSI and EIT tracks look the most similar
 which was expected as they have comparable angular accuracy (see Fig.

\begin_layout Subsection
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We showed that EuDX is a fast deterministic tractography method which can
 be used to propagate in crossing and non-crossing areas in simulations
 and human subjects.
 With the help of expert neuroanatomists we confirmed that EuDX can be used
 to find bundles which are known from anatomy like AC, CST and we investigated
 how CG looked between different subjects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently the neuroanatomists are continuing inspecting and segmenting more
 and more bundles and we hope that in the near future we will have a large
 collection of segmented bundles.
 These will be used to create better tractography algorithms by prior anatomical
 knowledge or exploit supervised learning techniques in order to find similar
 bundles in non-labeled subjects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of EuDX is to be faithful to the reconstruction results rather
 than try to correct or enhance them by introducing regional or global considera
tions which is the topic of other methods which were reviewed earlier.
 Therefore, EuDX serves mainly as a robust method for quickly inspecting
 different reconstruction results using deterministic tractography.
 However, we observed that EuDX performed better than standard probabilistic
 approaches in the simulations.
 This observation needs further exploration and contradicts what is commonly
 assumed i.e.
 that probabilistic tractography will perform better.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We think that most algorithms concentrated on inferring the distributions
 of the major directions in each voxel.
 Nevertheless, not much attention was payed to the actual track density
 and integrity of the bundle.
 We believe this is an important issue especially for clinical applications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EuDX will stop tracking on voxels with low anisotropy and will not take
 into consideration other voxels as it would happen with other probabilistic
 techniques.
 This property is often useful when validating underlying reconstruction
 models.
 Furthermore we showed that EuDX can take as input many different anisotropic
 functions: FA and QA or PK which have no restrictions for the underlying
 model neither to the number of peaks per voxel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The source code for EuDX can be found in module
