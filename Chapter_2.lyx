 A further division considers the level of model assumptions for the diffusion
 process.
 Although all methods have some underlying assumptions we generally separate
 them in model-based and model-free.
 Model-based methods like the Single Tensor or Multi Tensor 
\change_deleted 0 1331650589
necessitate the fitting from a few to many
\change_inserted 0 1331650594

 parameters

\change_deleted 0 1331650619
with
\change_inserted 0 1331650619
for
\change_unchanged
 model-free methods fitting is not necessary and the directionality of the
 underlying tissue can be approximated by some re-parametrization or re-transfor
mation of the signal.
 The latter is usually more efficient than fitting models with many parameters
\change_inserted 0 1331650739

\change_unchanged
 presents and evaluates
\change_inserted 0 1331650836
 and compares
\change_unchanged
 different model-free methods for the reconstruction of orientation distribution
 functions using diffusion MRI data sampled on a Cartesian lattice in

-space.
 This non-parametric nature of the algorithms described here allows for
 the identification of multiple fibre crossings.
 In addition a new method is presented named Diffusion Nabla Imaging (DNI)
 and a family of methods is defined called the Equatorial Inversion Transform
 (EIT).
 The EIT is a new way to represent and reconstruct the diffusion signal.
 Our results show that it can perform better or as

The addition of the spin density plays a very important role on normalizing
 the ODF and providing scalar or vector metrics for the analysis of dMRI
 data sets.
 GQI similarly with DSI expects the q-vectors to sit on a cubic lattice
 within a sphere.
 However, because of the direct analytical formulation of the GQI ODFs;
 the creation of the volumetric grid with the signal values is not necessary.
 This makes this GQI advantageous on memory and CPU efficiency.
 Furthermore, no Hanning filter is necessary.

A new method for the calculation of the real ODF is proposed here.

\begin_layout Subsection
Equatorial Inversion Transform
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I propose an important theoretical construction called the Equatorial Inversion
 Transform (EIT) which creates a general formulation for the interpretation
 of the directionality of the diffusion signal.
 This idea is founded on two general properties of the diffusion signal:
 a) If we visualize the diffusion signal for a single fiber for all gradient
 directions we see that a shape is generated which is smallest towards the
 direction of the fiber and biggest on the plane perpendicular to that direction
 (see fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Flo:single_fibre_spherical_grid"

\end_inset

).
 b) The diffusion signal is additive i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\hat{\mathbf{f}}_{1})+S(\hat{\mathbf{f}}_{2})=S(\hat{\mathbf{f}}_{1}+\hat{\mathbf{f}}_{2})$
\end_inset

 , where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{f}}_{1}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{f}}_{2}$
\end_inset

 are the unit directions of the fibres.
 In simple terms the signal of 2-fibre crossing can be decomposed linearly
 to the signals of the two fibres that create the crossing.
 The same holds for any number of fibres in a crossing.

 The diffusion signal has the beautiful property to be minimum along the
 direction of a fibre with unit direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\hat{\bm{f}}}$
\end_inset

 and maximum along the equator defined by the plane perpendicular to that
 fibre direction.
 This property is the basic inspiration behind the EIT.

 proposed a new method for reconstructing the diffusion propagator by applying
 an iterative inverse Radon transform on measurements along many radial
 lines; computing 1D tomographic projections to reconstruct the 3D EAP.
 This technique measures DW images along a few radial lines of q-space but
 still requires hundreds of samples to reliably recover the EAP.
 Currently, to reconstruct the EAP, the state-of-the-art model-free techniques
 apart from diffusion spectrum imaging are hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI)

 In mq-DPI the EAP is calculated by solving Laplace's equation for the diffusion
 signal using a real and symmetric modiﬁed spherical harmonic basis.
 The EAP can be found analytically by the inversion of a linear system using
 Laplace-Beltrami regularization.

 proposed a different function on the sphere than the ODFs described above,
 to be used on data sets acquired on a single spherical q-space shell.
 They called this spherical function persistent angular structure (PAS).
 This method has very good angular resolution because it uses the principle
 of maximum entropy however it is rather slow as it uses nonlinear fitting
 in order to identify many parameters.
 PAS is a statistic on the sphere defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $PAS(\hat{\mathbf{u}})=\exp(\lambda_{0}+\sum_{j=1}^{N}\lambda_{j}\cos(\mathbf{q}_{j}\cdot k\hat{\mathbf{u}}))$
\end_inset

 are the unknown parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is constant and

 The relationship 
\begin_inset Formula $\int PAS(\hat{\mathbf{u}})\exp(i\mathbf{q}_{j}\cdot k\hat{\mathbf{u}})d\hat{\mathbf{u}}=E(\mathbf{q}_{j})$

 who extends the current derivations for diffusion signal reconstruction
 and provides both scalar and vector metrics that facilitate the understanding
 of the underlying signal and its use for fast and accurate tractography.
 The key issue is the re-entrance of the spin density as an important part
 of the diffusion voxel reconstruction.
 The spin density together with the diffusion propagator give rise to the
 spin propagator.
 From the spin propagator both old metrics like FA and MD can be calculated
 non-parametrically along with new metrics as NPA which give higher insight
 on the underlying signal in a model free fashion.
 We also show important comparisons between FA and QA0 (quantitative anisotropy
 - first component) in different acquisition paradigms.

 This suggests that if for example we use a reconstruction sphere of

 steps and the equatorial (

Fast EIT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A much faster algorithm than the standard EIT is described here.
 The main idea is that we can store the sum of the radial integrals for
 every vertex in the reconstruction sphere and then we can also precompute
 the indices of the vertices that are near the equator of every vertex (inside
 an equatorial zone) see fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Flo:sEITvsEIT"

(B).
 After these calculations the spherical distribution function can be approximate
d with much less operations.
 The full algorithm is given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Alg:Fast_EIT"

\end_inset

.
 The in input is the vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\bm{u}}_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the reconstruction sphere and the normalized signal 
\begin_inset Formula $E.$
\end_inset

 Then for every point of the reconstruction sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\bm{u}}_{i}$
\end_inset

 we save the indices of the vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\bm{u}}_{j}$
\end_inset

 ,which are inside an equatorial zone, in list 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The width of the equatorial zone 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is a constant set empirically to 
\begin_inset Formula $5^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 .
 If a very highly dense reconstruction sphere is used with more than 
\begin_inset Formula $642$
\end_inset

 vertices which is the one we used then the zone can be smaller.
 That can potentially increase the angular resolution of the method.

 Every face contains the

 indices which indicate at the

 The idea here is that we can travel from face to face and nullify all points
 on a face which are lower that the higher value of the face.
 At the end only local maxima will survive the procedure.
 The algorithm is presented in detail in alg.

\begin_layout Standard
The idea here is that we first create any orbital function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(t):\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and calculate numerically its derivatives at small steps 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

.
 Then we can scale it and centre it so that it fits in an image volume of
 size that we desire.
 We expect that many segments of the discrete function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 will fall into every voxel in the volume and that more curved parts of
 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 will have higher representation in the voxel than less curved parts.
 For every segment we can find the main direction of the orbit 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\frac{f(t+1)-f(t)}{\Delta t}$
\end_inset

 and calculate the rotation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

 that rotates 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{x}}=(1,0,0)$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the signal for each element of the fibre for a given b-value 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and a given gradient sampling direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{g}}$
\end_inset

, is given by the following Single Tensor formula

In addition, we can generate simulations of more than one fibre
\change_deleted 0 1331733268
s
\change_unchanged
 by generating a single volume for every orbit and then add them all together
 to create complex configurations in the final volume.
 This is acceptable
\change_inserted 0 1331733326
, under the assumption that the diffusion is Gaussian in all compartments,
\change_unchanged
 because the diffusion signal is additive i.e.
 the signal of a crossing of two fibres is equal to the sum of the the signals
 of the individual fibres.
 In th
\change_deleted 0 1331733336

\change_inserted 0 1331733336
is
\change_unchanged
 way we can simulate phantoms with Multi Tensor based diffusion signals
 as that described in eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 We can increase the thickness of the fibres using a typical smoothing kernel
 or duplicate the fibres radially.
 At the end we can add different levels of noise e.g.
 Rician or Gaussian noise with a prespecified SNR.

The method we use to create these digital phantoms offers the opportunity

With the purpose of comparing and visualizing the differences between the
 reconstruction methods described in this

document
\change_inserted 0 1331733481
chapter
\change_unchanged
 
\change_deleted 0 1331733523
we created 
\change_unchanged
a digital phantom of two crossing bundles
\change_inserted 0 1331733530
 was created
\change_unchanged
.
 The bundles are crossing at an angle of 
\begin_inset Formula $90^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 The digital phantom was generated using the method described in the previous
 section.
 Here we describe the basic steps: (a) We first represented the first bundle
 as a discrete straight 
\change_deleted 0 1331734351
orbit
\change_inserted 0 1331734352
path
\change_unchanged
 starting from point 
\begin_inset Formula $(-1,-1,0)$
\end_inset

 and ending at point 
\begin_inset Formula $(1,1,0)$
\end_inset

 with using 
\begin_inset Formula $1000$
\end_inset

 time steps.
 (b) We scaled, centred and radially expanded this 
\change_deleted 0 1331734363
orbit
\change_inserted 0 1331734364
path
\change_unchanged
 so that it fits a volume of size 
\begin_inset Formula $64\times64\times64$
\end_inset

.
 This volume corresponds to the diffusion volume without any weighting.
 (c)
\change_inserted 0 1331734396
 
\change_unchanged
We then applied the weightings for all the following volumes corresponding
 to non-zero b-values.
 (d) We replicated the same procedure for the other bundle which initially
 started as an orbit from position 
\begin_inset Formula $(-1,1,0)$
\end_inset

 and ended at position 
\begin_inset Formula $(1,-1,0)$
\end_inset

.
 (e) We added the two volumes together to create an 'x' shape (see fig.

 (f) We added Rician noise with SNR=

 As in this document we concentrate on Cartesian Lattice Q-space acquisitions
 we generated b-vectors and b-values by using a keyhole Cartesian sampling

 It is well known that noise affects more less anisotropic areas.
 We can see this effect by comparing the overlapped FAs of these two figures
 (

 However we can also see that all six methods (DSI, GQI, GQI2, EITL, EITL2,
 EITS) can resolve correctly the fiber directions by looking at their spherical
 distribution functions colourmaped with a standard 'jet' colourmap.

 shows that all these different grid-based reconstruction methods can reconstruc
t correctly the underlying fibre directions even when noise is present.
 However we can see that when tensors are less anisotropic the noise has
 a stronger effect in the resulting spherical distributions.
 We can also see that GQI & ETS are less sharp than DSI & EITL and these
 are less sharp than GQI2 & EITL2.
 Also DSI, GQI2, EITL, EITL2 have much lower minima than GQI and EITS.

Anisotropy metrics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until this moment we discussed about density functions on the sphere as
 a way to represent complex fibre directionality in the voxel.
 These density functions are represented as multidimensional vectors containing
 
\begin_inset Formula $200$
\end_inset

 or more dimensions in each voxel and it can be cumbersome to use them directly
 for subject comparisons or visualization purposes.
 For this purpose most people use simple scalar summarizing metrics e.g.
 Tensor-based FA, MD or ODF-based 
\change_inserted 0 1331801896
such as
\change_deleted 0 1331801893
like
\change_unchanged
 the Generalized FA (GFA) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In this section we will show that a similar scalar function like FA can
 be constructed non-parametrically.
 We call this NPA which stands for non-parametric anisotropy.
 We will also start experimenting with metrics that have more than one scalar
 value
\change_deleted 0 1331801924

 and can represent more accurately the directionality in each voxel that
 is lost with FA, GFA and MD.
 We will investigate and explain here the realms and robustness of Quantitative
 Anisotropy which was first introduced by Yeh et al.

Non-parametric Anisotropy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Local voxelwise measures such as fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusivit
y coefficient (ADC), or mean diffusivity (MD) [1,2] have been extensively
 adopted in clinical and applied research practice based on diffusion weighted
 MR imaging (dMRI).
 This underlines the need for valid and reliable measures which can indicate
 the degree of local organisation of white matter in the brain.
 The measures listed above are based on the parametric simple diffusion
 tensor (SDT) model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Basser1994"

\end_inset

 which works well when there is a single dominant fibre direction but is
 also known not to give valid information if the local organisation is more
 complex 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yeh2010,Tuch2002ThesisMIT"

\end_inset

.
 We show how model-free, alternatives can yield non-parametric anisotropy
 (NPA).
 These are constructed from the GQI ODF.
 We apply exact analytical results which show the form of the GQI-ODF when
 the single tensor model is correct, and further indicate how the tensor's
 parameters may be estimated from this model-free approach.
 We compare the performance of these parametric and non-parametric measures
 for simulated data.

Simulations were computed for a

-point grid sampling scheme, with a maximum b-value of 
\begin_inset Formula $4000\,\textrm{s}/\textrm{mm}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The simulated fibre was aligned with the gradient frame of reference, and
 the diagonal elements of the diffusion tensor, D, where chosen to match
 typical values for white matter: 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=1.4\times10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 Variable fibre orientation was realised by spatially rotating the simulated
 fibres at discrete orientations.

In addition to the SDT a two compartment model with an isotropic component

\begin_inset Formula $0.5$

 and diffusivity 
\begin_inset Formula $0.7\times10^{-3}\,\textrm{mm}^{2}/\textrm{s}$
\end_inset

 For each acquisition scheme and fibre type, the “ideal” (noise-free) diffusion
 weighted signals were calculated according to the SDT model, assuming a
 constant ideal value of the baseline signal 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}=100$
\end_inset

.
 Complex Gaussian noise was then superimposed upon the ideal signals to
 provide the complex noise-contaminated signals and their magnitude was
 then obtained.
 This results in noisy values with a Rician distribution, which can be scaled
 in order to set the signal to noise ratio to any desired level.

The average NPA and FA are presented below for 
\begin_inset Formula $200$

 simulations for each noise level, and single fibres with or without an

 We can see that NPA gives very similar results with FA and as expected
 it is modulated by the degree of smoothing controlled by the value of the
 diffusion sampling length.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph

We plan to extend this approach with voxels containing multiple peaks where
 FA would be unable to give an informative result and also extend it to
 other types of ODFs.
 In summary, we have shown that an informative new scalar anisotropy function
 (NPA) can be calculated without fitting just from the GQI ODF which promises
 to be a model-free proxy for FA.
 NPA differs from GFA

 QA can be also easily normalized by the maximum ODF value of all voxels
 which is usually at the CSF where there is a great amount of water.
 If this normalization is in effect then we can very easily remove the backgroun

 non-white matter areas, scalp, skin, muscles etc.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Robustness of QA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GQI was shown to have comparable accuracy to other well established q-space
 methods when it comes to resolving crossing fibres.
 In addition, this is achievable with as little as 
\begin_inset Formula $102$
\end_inset

 points on a grid sampling scheme, bringing the total acquisition time down
 to a clinically acceptable level.
 Another advantage of GQI is that it is also applicable to a shell sampling
 scheme.
 Despite their successes in tractography applications, q-space techniques
 have until now failed to produce scalar metrics that could replace the
 ones derived from the diffusion tensor model (e.g.
 mean diffusivity, MD, and fractional anisotropy, FA) in terms of their
 multi-subject comparability and specificity to pathology.
 The data acquired with a grid sampling scheme can still be used to estimate
 a diffusion tensor and respective scalar parameters, but the effects of
 the high b-values required for q-space imaging (
\begin_inset Formula $>2000s/mm^{2}$
\end_inset

) in the accuracy of the resulting

 parameters has not been well characterized.
 The authors of GQI have also proposed a new scalar metric called quantitative
 anisotropy (QA) which was described in the previous sections, but its propertie
s have not been compared to FA’s.
 In this 
\change_deleted 0 1331807131

 we will compare the estimated values of MD, FA and

 (first component of QA) obtained with grid and shell sampling schemes,
 in terms of their precision and ability to differentiate between different
 brain fibre populations.

 For MD, no significant different was found for the CV across subjects,

 For FA and MD the

 difference was found for 
\begin_inset Formula $QA_{0}$
\end_inset

 scheme.
 FA also shows lower variation across subjects for both acquisition schemes.
 Finally, FA lower CVs within white matter ROIs, while QA0 shows less variabilit
y for grey matter.
 The results described and shown above were obtained with the cubic ROIs,
 but do not differ significantly when the same analysis was applied to larger
 anatomical ROIs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our results indicate that the MD and FA maps generated from a grid sampling
 scheme designed for GQI are still suitable for analysis, since they do
 not show poorer performance when compared to a single shell and low b-value
 acquisition.
 In fact, the overall results suggest that the 
\begin_inset Formula $102$
\end_inset

 grid sampling produces slightly more robust results than the 
\begin_inset Formula $118$
\end_inset

 shell acquisition.
 A previous study 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 has shown that metrics such as MD and FA benefit from the use of multiple
 b-values, which could explain the better performance of the

 grid scheme.

Discussion and Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-parametric methods have the advantage of representing the signal with
 minimum number of assumptions and without needing any fitting.
 For many years there has been a trend in science to prefer model-based
\change_deleted 0 1331807546
 methods
\change_unchanged
 rather than model free (non-parametric) 
\change_inserted 0 1331807602
methods.
 This is 
\change_unchanged
perhaps because model-based can be easier to describe, 
\change_deleted 0 1331807610
easier to invent 
\change_unchanged
and 
\change_deleted 0 1331807615
easier
\change_inserted 0 1331807623

.
 However, there are some crucial issues with fitting: (a) Usually the interestin
g models have many parameters and that makes fitting very slow.
 (b) Commonly non-linear fitting is needed and accurate fitting is not trivial.
 (c) Often the model does not represent precisely the complexity of the
 real problem.
 (d) The more complex the model, the more difficult to fit

introducing and developing
\change_deleted 0 1331807970
inventing
\change_unchanged
 new non-parametric methods (EIT) or comparing and extending existing ones
 (GQI2).
 We showed that a simple, fast and comprehensive transform exists that we
 call the Equatorial Inversion Transform (EIT).
 With this transform we showed that we can represent accurately the directional
 information of the diffusion signal.
 Furthermore we showed that they are many different functions (

) that can be used in order to create spherical density functions and use
 these to find the primary fibre directions.
 With a correct choose of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 we can create theoretically the same ODF as the real ODF (DSI ODF).
 This can be done using EITL which is a type of EIT.
 Nonetheless, other density functions can be created that can identify the
 leading fibre directions without being real ODFs but they are still different
 types of spherical densities.
 EITL2 and EITS where examples of this last case.

 If for some purpose the diffusion propagator is still required then DSI

are favourable.
 It could be interesting in the future to try and recover the propagator
 using ideas from the EIT.
 However, nearly always the propagator is not needed for the analysis.
 Furthermore, comparing 4D densities like the propagator is a non-trivial
 problem, also storing the propagator for every voxel is very inefficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We discussed that GQI can be used for creating Quantitative Anisotropy (QA).
 We observed that QA acts like a differential operator but also has some
 similarities with FA as it is maximum on anisotropic and 0 on isotropic
 voxels.
 QA assumes that a 
\change_deleted 0 1331808415
fat
\change_inserted 0 1331808418
substantial
\change_unchanged
 isotropic part can always be removed from the ODF and that makes it more
 favourable for spherical functions like those of GQI and EITS.
 This is in contrast to sharper densities like those of DSI and GQI2 where
 QA is not that much useful because the minimum value of these densities
 will be usually near 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GQI needs a manually set parameter; the diffusion sampling length and in
 contrast the EIT is fully automatic i.e.
 we always just used the few default parameters for all experiments.
 The diffusion sampling length can be slightly different from experiment
 to experiment.
 The asset of GQI and GQI2 (which was presented together with GQI but not
 investigated until today) is that they are fast to compute and have simple
 analytical solutions.
 GQI2 seems robust and smooth and it has good performance both with simulations
 and real data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to stress that there are similarities between all these
 methods; DSI similar

 In addition we showed that we can denoise the signal using a Gaussian Spherical
 Angular method which operates on spherical densities and has a single parameter
 which is similar with the variance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we showed that the first component of QA (highest QA value) can
 be used for subject comparisons in a similar way with FA.
 We also showed that NPA could replace FA if we want to calculate anisotropy
 in a completely geometric way.
