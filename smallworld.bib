  abstract = {Small-world properties have been demonstrated for many complex networks.
	Here, we applied the discrete wavelet transform to functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) time series, acquired from healthy volunteers
	in the resting state, to estimate frequency-dependent correlation
	matrices characterizing functional connectivity between 90 cortical
	and subcortical regions. After thresholding the wavelet correlation
	matrices to create undirected graphs of brain functional networks,
	we found a small-world topology of sparse connections most salient
	in the low-frequency interval 0.03-0.06 Hz. Global mean path length
	(2.49) was approximately equivalent to a comparable random network,
	whereas clustering (0.53) was two times greater; similar parameters
	have been reported for the network of anatomical connections in the
	macaque cortex. The human functional network was dominated by a neocortical
	core of highly connected hubs and had an exponentially truncated
	power law degree distribution. Hubs included recently evolved regions
	of the heteromodal association cortex, with long-distance connections
	to other regions, and more cliquishly connected regions of the unimodal
	association and primary cortices; paralimbic and limbic regions were
	topologically more peripheral. The network was more resilient to
	targeted attack on its hubs than a comparable scale-free network,
	but about equally resilient to random error. We conclude that correlated,
	low-frequency oscillations in human fMRI data have a small-world
	architecture that probably reflects underlying anatomical connectivity
	of the cortex. Because the major hubs of this network are critical
	for cognition, its slow dynamics could provide a physiological substrate
	for segregated and distributed information processing},

  abstract = {The metric structure of synaptic connections is obviously an important
	factor in shaping the properties of neural networks, in particular
	the capacity to retrieve memories, with which are endowed autoassociative
	nets operating via attractor dynamics. Qualitatively, some real networks
	in the brain could be characterized as 'small worlds', in the sense
	that the structure of their connections is intermediate between the
	extremes of an orderly geometric arrangement and of a geometry-independent
	random mesh. Small worlds can be defined more precisely in terms
	of their mean path length and clustering coefficient; but is such
	a precise description useful for a better understanding of how the
	type of connectivity affects memory retrieval? We have simulated
	an autoassociative memory network of integrate-and-fire units, positioned
	on a ring, with the network connectivity varied parametrically between
	ordered and random. We find that the network retrieves previously
	stored memory patterns when the connectivity is close to random,
	and displays the characteristic behavior of ordered nets (localized
	'bumps' of activity) when the connectivity is close to ordered. Recent
	analytical work shows that these two behaviors can coexist in a network
	of simple threshold -linear units, leading to localized retrieval
	states. We find that they tend to be mutually exclusive behaviors,
	however, with our integrate-and-fire units. Moreover, the transition
	between the two occurs for values of the connectivity parameter which
	are not simply related to the notion of small worlds. (c) 2007 Elsevier

  abstract = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by
	dense local clustering or cliquishness of connections between neighboring
	nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes
	due to the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This
	is an attractive model for the organization of brain anatomical and
	functional networks because a small-world topology can support both
	segregated/specialized and distributed/integrated information processing.
	Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to minimize
	wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors
	introduce some of the key mathematical concepts in graph theory required
	for small-world analysis and review how these methods have been applied
	to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from
	anatomical tract-tracing studies in the macaque monkey and the cat.
	The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a

	Magnetoencephalographic data were acquired from 22 subjects, half
	of whom performed a finger-tapping task, whereas the other half were
	studied at rest. We found that brain functional networks were characterized
	by small-world properties at all six wavelet scales considered, corresponding
	approximately to classical delta (low and high), theta, alpha, beta,
	and gamma frequency bands. Global topological parameters (path length,
	clustering) were conserved across scales, most consistently in the
	frequency range 2-37 Hz, implying a scale-invariant or fractal small-world
	organization. Dynamical analysis showed that networks were located
	close to the threshold of order/disorder transition in all frequency
	bands. The highest-frequency gamma network had greater synchronizability,
	greater clustering of connections, and shorter path length than networks
	in the scaling regime of (lower) frequencies. Behavioral state did
	not strongly influence global topology or synchronizability; however,
	motor task performance was associated with emergence of long-range
	connections in both beta and gamma networks. Long-range connectivity,
	e.g., between frontal and parietal cortex, at high frequencies during
	a motor task may facilitate sensorimotor binding. Human brain functional
	networks demonstrate a fractal small-world architecture that supports
	critical dynamics and task-related spatial reconfiguration while

  volume = {195},
  pages = {188--206},

  abstract = {The paper proposes a new type of small-world networks of cells with
	chaotic behavior. This network consists of a regular lattice of cells
	with constant 2K-nearest neighbor couplings and time-dependent on-off
	couplings between any other pair of cells. In each time interval
	of duration tau such a coupling is switched on with probability p
	and the corresponding switching random variables are independent
	for different links and for different times. At each moment, the
	coupling structure corresponds to a small-world graph, but the shortcuts
	change from time interval to time interval, which is a good model
	for many real-world dynamical networks. It is to be distinguished
	from networks that have randomly chosen shortcuts, fixed in time.
	Here, we apply the Connection Graph Stability method, developed in
	the companion paper ("Connection graph stability method for synchronized
	coupled chaotic systems", see this issue), to the study of global
	synchronization in this network with the time-varying coupling structure,
	in the case where the on-off switching is fast with respect to the
	characteristic synchronization time of the network. The synchronization
	thresholds are explicitly linked with the average path length of
	the coupling graph and with the probability p of shortcut switchings
	in this blinking model. We prove that for the blinking model, a few
	random shortcut additions significantly lower the synchronization
	threshold together with the effective characteristic path length.
	Short interactions between cells, as in the blinking model, are important
	in practice. To cite prominent examples, computers networked over
	the Internet interact by sending packets of information, and neurons
	in our brain interact by sending short pulses, called spikes. The
	rare interaction between arbitrary nodes in the network greatly facilitates
	synchronization without loading the network much. In this respect,
	we believe that it is more efficient than a structure of fixed random
	connections. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved},

	Alternating Pattern (CAP) conditions, using concepts derived from
	Graph Theory. Methods: We evaluated spatial patterns of EEG slow-wave
	synchronization between all possible pairs of electrodes (19) placed
	over the scalp of 10 sleeping healthy young normal subjects using
	two graph theoretical measures: the clustering coefficient (Cp) and
	the characteristic path length (Lp). The measures were obtained during
	the different sleep stages and CAP conditions from the real EEG connectivity
	networks and randomized control (surrogate) networks (Cp-s and Lp-s).
	Results: Cp and Cp/Cp-s increased significantly from wakefulness
	to sleep while Lp and Lp/Lp-s did not show changes. Cp/Cp-s was higher
	for A1 phases, compared to B phases of CAP. Conclusions: The network
	organization of the EEG slow-wave synchronization during sleep shows
	features characteristic of small-world networks (high Cp combined
	with low Lp); this type of organization is slightly but significantly
	more evident during the CAP Al subtypes. Significance: Our results

	which slow-wave synchronization shows optimal network organization

	monkeys. Analysis of these data suggests that differences in the
	social systems of Aotus, Callicebus, Saimiri, Callimico, Saguinus,
	Leontopithecus, Cebuella and Callithrix are closely tied to both
	the costs of reproduction and to the ontogenetic requirements of
	maturing young. In Saimiri, both rapid prenatal body weight and perinatal
	brain growth result in relatively high metabolic costs to breeding
	females. These costs, coupled with minimal nonmaternal assistance
	in caregiving, appear to favor a reproductive strategy that limits
	offspring production to a single birth at 2-year intervals. In contrast,
	tamarins and marmosets are capable of producing twins twice in the
	same year. Prenatal investment in each offspring is relatively low,
	and the potentially high postnatal costs of nursing 2 infants are
	minimized by the evolution of a social system involving extensive
	extramaternal caregiving. Cooperative infant care in callitrichins
	(tamarins and marmosets) serves to distribute the metabolic costs
	of infant ontogeny among several group members. Callimico is also
	characterized by a high reproductive output, with females capable
	of producing a single infant twice during the year. Infants continue
	to grow rapidly after weaning. Patterns of infant development in
	Callimico are similar to those found in tamarins and marmosets and
	support a close phylogenetic relationship among these taxa, Aotus
	and Callicebus are characterized by an alternative strategy. In these
	taxa, a monogamous mating system is associated with paternal certainty,
	male parental care, and provisioning of the young. The transfer of
	male energetic resources to a single offspring allows night and titi
	monkeys to maintain a comparatively short interbirth interval (1
	year). Ecological and social factors, such as predation and feeding
	competition, do not appear to adequately explain much of the observed
	variation in infant development and preadult growth rates in these
	platyrrhines. Instead, reproductive strategies are strongly linked

	Many previous neuroimaging studies have provided consistent evidence
	of dysfunctional connectivity among the brain regions in schizophrenia;
	however, little is known about whether or not this dysfunctional
	connectivity causes disruption of the topological properties of brain
	functional networks. To this end, we investigated the topological
	properties of human brain functional networks derived from resting-state
	functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Data was obtained from
	31 schizophrenia patients and 31 healthy subjects; then functional
	connectivity between 90 cortical and sub-cortical regions was estimated
	by partial correlation analysis and thresholded to construct a set
	of undirected graphs. Our findings demonstrated that the brain functional
	networks had efficient small-world properties in the healthy subjects;
	whereas these properties were disrupted in the patients with schizophrenia.
	Brain functional networks have efficient small-world properties which
	support efficient parallel information transfer at a relatively low
	cost. More importantly, in patients with schizophrenia the small-world
	topological properties are significantly altered in many brain regions
	in the prefrontal, parietal and temporal lobes. These findings are
	consistent with a hypothesis of dysfunctional integration of the

	EEG recordings of 7 patients for 5 periods of interest: interictal,
	before-, during- and after rapid discharges (in which the last two
	periods are ictal) and postictal. For each period, graphs (abstract

	play a role in various brain phenomena, we have observed two distinct
	dynamical transitions in the activity of excitable media where waves
	propagate both between neighboring regions and through LRCs. When
	the LRC density p is low, single or multiple spiral waves are seen
	to emerge and cover the entire system. This state is self-sustaining
	and robust against perturbations. At p=p(c)(l), the spirals are suppressed,
	and there is a transition to a spatially homogeneous, temporally
	periodic state. Finally, above p=p(c)(u), activity ceases after a
	brief transient},

	fractal or self-similar patterns. We describe a simple procedure

	potential self-similarity and hierarchical ordering of neuronal connections.
	We examine these connection patterns by calculating a broad range
	of structural measures, including small-world attributes and motif
	composition, as well as some global measures of functional connectivity,
	including complexity. As we vary fractal patterns by changing a critical
	control parameter, we find strongly correlated changes in several
	structural and functional measures, suggesting that they emerge together
	and are mutually linked. Measures obtained from some modeled fractal
	patterns closely resemble those of real neuroanatomical data sets,
	supporting the original hypothesis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
