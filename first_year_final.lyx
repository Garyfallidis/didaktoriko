Introduction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is the only non-invasive method that provides information
 about the neural tracts found in white matter and the cortex.
 dMRI acquires one or more T2-weighted reference images, and a collection
 of diffusion-weighted images that attenuate the T2 signal according to
 the amount of diffusion along prescribed gradient directions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DiffMRIBook"

\end_inset

.
 The information is not complete and the tracts cannot be reconstructed
 in full detail 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "denislebihan2006aap"

\end_inset

.
 However, some spatial structures and patterns can be visualised.
 These are usually represented as trajectories 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WWS+08"

\end_inset

 or connectivity maps 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Behrens2003NatureNeuroscience"

\end_inset

.
 The unique new area that aims to reconstruct the neural tracts from diffusion
 data is called diffusion tractography.
 Other types of tractography are based in staining using for example luxol-fast
 blue 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 but these can only be used with in vitro brains and they lack ease of repeatabi
lity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The field of diffusion tractography is less than ten years old.
 It started with Mori's first tractography algorithm FACT
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MCC+99"

\end_inset

 in 1999 and it is still a highly active field of research and development.
 We believe however that the resolution and accuracy of tractography today
 is weakened by the following problems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Poor acquisition schemes not specificly designed for tractography.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Over-simplistic local fiber direction modelling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Lack of gold standard phantoms and validation techniques for dMRI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Lack of robust and efficient tractography algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this thesis is to investigate possible solutions or improvements
 of existing solutions for all four problems.
 However, we focus more on problems 2 and 4.
 We want to be able to increase the resolution of tractography by taking
 into account global properties of the brain.
 We believe that by using whole brain discrete optimisation and Bayesian
 inference we will be able to remove many artifacts and ghosts, see section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Future-Plan"

\end_inset

.
 In order to decide which is the best way to go forward and plan our research
 strategy we had to study and test many different algorithms and approaches
 (see sections 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Algorithms-for-defining"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:FA-Results"

\end_inset

) and gather datasets obtained at the MRC-CBU (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fig:FACT"

\end_inset

 and 2) and elsewhere.
 Furthermore, we developed a new software library in Python which is able
 to visualise and interact with 3D/4D datasets, open medical files, calculate
 tensors, draw trajectories, and many other features, see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Software"

\end_inset

.
 We proposed and tested a new acquisition protocol that will hopefully replace
 the current default dMRI protocol in use at MRC-CBU, for more details see

 but here the deterministic algorithm R-K was used with the same 26 mm threshold.
 By comparing these two figures it is obvious that R-K generated thousands
 more tracts than FACT.
 So, which one is the best? The need for validation of existing tractography
 and the removal of ghost tracks is crucial for obtaining meaningful data.
 However, this is a very difficult problem for which we hope to spend our
 time investigating possible solutions and inventing new more accurate tractogra
phy algorithms.

\begin_layout Subsection
Terminology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Diffusion imaging has many specialist terms, and one source of confusion
 has been lack of clarity in the meaning of these terms.
 To start, we will use the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

diffusion weighted imaging
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (DWI) to refer to any MRI image acquisition that is weighted to be sensitive
 to diffusion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One major source of confusion is that terms are often used to refer both
 the type of 
\emph on
acquisition
\emph default
 used to acquire the data, and to the subsequent 
\emph on
analysis
\emph default
 of the data.
 The most egregious example is the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

diffusion tensor imaging
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (DTI).
 Used in a technical sense, the term refers to a very simple analysis model
 for the per-voxel diffusion direction profiles - a single diffusion tensor
 (SDT).
 However, it is also used to refer to all diffusion weighted imaging, or
 to a particular type of acquisition with a small number of diffusion gradient
 directions (of which more below).
 We will avoid the term DTI in this paper, and humbly suggest that it will
 reduce confusion if others do the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tractography is the process of spatially integrating local estimates of
 fiber directions throughout the brain.
 Tractography gives only an estimation of the real tracts.
 Consequently, when we use the term tract we will generally mean a tract
 or track estimated or computed using some algorithm, i.e.
 a trajectory, except if it is stated we are referring to an actual real
 tract.
 The terms tract and fiber are considered here equivalent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Diffusion Weighted Imaging signal 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is diffusion?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molecular diffusion is a process that is taking place all the time in fluids
 and accounts for a number of interesting phenomena; the dMRI signal measures
 the history of the random (Brownian) displacements of spin-labelled hydrogen
 protons (spins) resolved in the direction of a magnetic field gradient.
 Though the actual probability displacement function of the protons is unaffecte
d by the presence or variation in the magnetic field, the cumulative phase
 change in the spins reflects the changes in the position-dependent spin
 frequency induced by the field gradient.
 Components of the motion along the direction of the gradient induce such
 changes.
 The signal change due to cumulative dephasing is greatest when this coincides
 with a direction that allows greater random displacements, e.g.
 because of the orientation of a microstructure within which the proton
 is moving.
 It is this link between the directional dependence of the dMRI signal and
 the orientations of the supposed underlying brain fibres that provides
 the unique insights of diffusion tractography.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anisotropy is one of the terms that are very common in diffusion terminology.
 Anisotropy means that the average displacement of the particles is greater
 along a preferred direction.
 On the other hand, isotropy means that the particles are equally likely
 to move in any direction.
 It is anisotropy, i.e.
 directional dependence of diffusion that is the basis of dMRI.
 In dMRI the protons will move more along the directions of the axons and
 less perpendicular to that direction.
 For a biological interpretation of the signal measured with dMRI see

 also showed how these bulk properties could be derived by statistical methods
 from the collective spin histories of individual protons.
 When a molecule is at position 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

, we cannot say where it will be after time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, we can only model a distribution of possible locations.
 This motion is described by a propagator 
\begin_inset Formula $P(x;x_{o},t)$
\end_inset

 which defines the probability of being in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 after a time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the primary interest of dMRI is the way that the sigal depends on
 the direction of underlying fiber orientations., it is the orientation informati
on in this propagator that is potentially of interest.
 The orientation distribution function (ODF) expresses the probability of
 a spin displacing into a differential solid angle about a possible fibre
 direction 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

.
 This is used in order to model and visualise the directional information
 in diffusion propagator and in simple words it just projects the diffusion
 function on to the sphere by integrating over the radial coordinate of
 the diffusion function.
 The ODF representation symbolised below with 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 sacrifices all the radial information but retains the relevant directional
 information:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
f(\mathbf{u})=\int_{0}^{\infty}P(\rho\mathbf{u})\, d\rho\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is a unit normal vector and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\rho}$
\end_inset

 is the radial coordinate in the diffusion space.
 Stejskal and Tanner 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Stejskal1965JChemPhys"

\end_inset

 showed that the spin echo magnitude 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\mathbf{q},t)$
\end_inset

 from a PGSE experiment (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Acquisition-sequences-in-use"

\end_inset

) is directly related with the diffusion propagator by the following Fourier
 relation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
S(\mathbf{q},t)=S_{0}\int P(\mathbf{R},t)e^{i\mathbf{q}^{T}\mathbf{R}}d\mathbf{R}\label{eq:fourier}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the signal in the absense of the applied diffusion gradient, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

 is the relative spin displacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{0}$
\end_inset

at diffusion time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 is the spin displacement wave vector.
 With the inverse Fourier transform we can reconstruct the diffusion propagator
 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 by measuring the signal in a number of different directions and gradient
 magnitudes.
 Q-space imaging (QSI) and Diffusion Spectrum Imaging (DSI) are the best
 known methods which try to reconstruct the full diffusion propagator in
 that way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the diffusion propagator is given by a 3-dimensional Gaussian
 distribution we can write 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
P(\mathbf{R},t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi t^{3}\mid\mathbf{D}\mid}}exp(-\frac{\mathbf{R}^{T}\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{R}}{4t})\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{D}$
\end_inset

 is known as the diffusion tensor.
 This tensor is a 3D symmetric matrix that can be completely described by
 a centred ellipsoid with axes (eigenvalues) 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\lambda_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Fractional Anisotropy (FA) is a very common metric in diffusion imaging
 which is used to characterise the presence or absence of a prefered direction
 for diffusion.
 It is is calculated from the eigenvalues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
FA=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{\sqrt{(\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2})^{2}+(\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{3})^{2}+(\lambda_{3}-\lambda_{1})^{2}}}{\sqrt{\lambda_{1}^{2}+\lambda_{2}^{2}+\lambda_{3}^{2}}}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If FA is equal to 1 that means very anisotropic (infinitely prolonged ellipsoid)
 and if FA is equal to 0 that means completely isotropic (sphere).
 FA is used in clinical studies to diagnose diseases like stroke and cancer
 and asses the progress of therapy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "maddah_phdthesis2008"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever we are using FA volumes we assume that the propagator of the spin
 displacements in every voxel will be a 3D Gaussian distribution.
 This assumption is used in most of diffusion related literature.
 Unfortunately, in reality things are much more complicated; inside our
 brain the axons are semi-permeable (restriction), the water molecules interact
 with many different elements in the complex intra fibre fluid, the fibres
 might cross, kiss, divert or bent inside a voxel.
 Therefore, assuming a Gaussian distribution is a non-trivial approximation.

\begin_layout Standard
The best known method for generating diffusion-weighted images is called
 Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo method (PGSE), also known as the Stejskal and
 Tanner method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Stejskal1965JChemPhys"

\end_inset

.
 This has 90-180 degrees spin echo pair of RF pulses with one gradient before
 the second pulse and one equal gradient after the second pulse (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mcrobbie2006mpp"

\end_inset

, p329), see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fig:pgse"

\end_inset

.
 The refocusing is perfect only when the spins do not move between the two
 pulses.
 The diffusion weighted contrast acts like inverse 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$
\end_inset

 weighting i.e.
 tissues with mobile water molecules give lower signal than more solid tissues
 with smaller mobility.
 Eddy currents caused by the onset and offset of the gradients are a problem
 with PGSE and most systems (including Siemens) use twice-refocused spin
 echo sequences 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Reese2003MRM"

\end_inset

 to reduce these artifacts.
 Every time the magnetic field gradients switch they generate currents that
 generate other smaller magnetic fields which disturb the spins.
 The TRSE sequence is an improvement on the PGSE.
 The improvement is made using another refocusing pulse surrounded by the
 inverse mirror of the previous diffusion gradients (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fig:pgse"

\end_inset

).
 By adjusting the timing of the diffusion gradients, eddy currents can be
 nulled or greatly reduced.
 This sequence improves the image quality without loss of scanning efficiency
 i.e.
 TR duration and it is the standard in most modern MRI scanners.

 is the diffusion coefficient that we wish to measure and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$

 the crucial experimental parameter diffusion weighting parameter or 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 Although the PGSE is useful for expository clarity, in reality more complicated
 but related sequences such as the twice-refocused spin-echo (TRSE)

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Auerbach2004ISMRM"

\end_inset

 are employed as a means of removing the distortion effects from eddy currents
 resulting from the initial and final ramps of the gradient pulses.
 The important point is that we can control the size of the b-values by
 changing the strength and timings of the gradient pulses and that depending
 on the b-value, we can expect different amount of signal loss.
 A further important simplifying assumption made is that the function 
\begin_inset Formula $S(b)$

 is described by a single exponential term (mono-exponential).
 In fact there is evidence that this assumption may break down at higher

What is DWI?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) is MRI imaging designed to be sensitive
 to diffusion.
 With this imaging technique we attempt to delineate the axonal organisation
 of the brain.
 A diffusion weighted image is a volume of voxels gathered by applying only
 one gradient direction to our sequence.
 Therefore, the signal in every voxel should be low if there is greater
 mobility of water molecules along the specified gradient direction and
 it should be high if there is less movement in the same direction.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\emph on
mobility

as a short hand for 
\emph on

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

Therefore if inside a voxel there is an underlying fibre that is parallel
 to this direction we should expect a lower value otherwise if the fibre
 is not parallel or near parallel or if there is no underlying fibre we
 should expect a higher value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The directional dependence of the DWI signal is the cornerstone of diffusion
 based tractography.
 Signal from a specific voxel will be higher in directions where diffusivity
 is high, e.g.
 along the direction of a putative bundle of fibres, and lower into the
 walls of the constituent fibres.

\begin_layout Subsection
What is q-space?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q-space is the space of one or more 3D spin displacement wave vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 as shown in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:fourier"

\end_inset

.
 This vector is related to the applied magnetic gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}$
\end_inset

 by the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}=(2\pi)^{-1}\gamma\delta\mathbf{g}$
\end_inset

.
 Every single vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 has the same orientation of the direction of diffusion gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}$
\end_inset

 and length proportional to the strength of the gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 Every single point in q-space corresponds to a 3D volume of the brain for
 a specific gradient direction and strength.
 Therefore if for example we have programmed the scanner to apply 60 gradient
 directions then our data should have 60 diffusion volumes with each volume
 obtained for a specific gradient.
 A Diffusion Weighted Image (DWI) is the volume acquired from only one direction
 gradient.
 Hence, in the previous example we would gather 60 DWI volumes.
 An alternative way to see 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 is in mathematical terms as the combination of parameters which produces
 a Fourier transform relationship between the diffusion signal and the probabili
ty displacement distribution.
 In these terms (see Callaghan 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Callaghan1991OUP"

\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 is the reciprocal of the probability displacement vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

, just as in conventional MRI 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 space is the reciprocal parametrisation of the brain space vector 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to represent dMRI is the following.
 We can combine all the DWIs together creating a new multidimensional image
 where each voxel corresponds to a profile of diffusion signals measured
 in all the chosen gradient directions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}$
\end_inset

.
 This is the only known way to represent all different acquisition methods
 with the same structure and we are planning to use it as the basis for
 our novel tractography algorithm (see section

Acquisition methods and defining terms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our introduction, we promised to be as clear as possible about the terms
 we use.
 One problem in diffusion imaging is that names for techniques often refer
 both to a particular type of imaging acquisition, and to the subsequent
 analysis model.
 All dMRI acquisition methods acquire data in q-space, and the methods can
 be categorised by their sampling pattern in q-space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We refer to a method as a 
\emph on
q-space shell
\emph default
 method if it is an acquisition method collecting a series of points in
 q-space that can be thought of as being on a curved surface, typically
 a sphere.
 Examples include techniques referred to as HARDI (High Angular Diffusion
 Imaging), Q-ball Imaging and HYDI (Hybrid Diffusion Imaging).
 A q-space shell method might involve a collection of a single shell (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fig:q-space"

\end_inset

C,E), e.g.
 QBI or multiple shells (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fig:q-space"

\end_inset

D) e.g.
 EQBI.
 In clinical settings where we can only use a few directions (less than
 60 with minimum 6) the only way is to use the SDT model (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fig:q-space"

\end_inset

B).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\emph on
q-space volume
\emph default
 method is an acquisition method that is more easily thought of as collecting
 points distributed through a volume in q-space.
 The characteristic example is DSI (Fig.

Deterministic vs Probabilistic Tracking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of different tractography algorithms for diffusion MRI data that
 have been introduced during recent years is enormous and it would be impossible
 to discuss them all here.
 There are two main families of local tracking algorithm: deterministic
 and probabilistic.
 We will begin by describing here the simplest or most popular deterministic
 approaches and then we will concentrate to the probabilistic approaches.
 A tractographic algorithm belongs to the probabilistic domain if the fibre
 model that is being used incorporates uncertainty i.e.
 errors in estimating the orientation of the fibre at every voxel.
 If it does not assume any uncertainty along the path of the track then
 it is deterministic.
 All tractography algorithms are based in local estimates of diffusion direction.
 For more information about different models of local estimates see

\begin_layout Standard
One of the simplest and first deterministic methods is called Fibre Assignment
 by Continuous Tracking (FACT) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MCC+99"

\end_inset

.
 The FACT algorithm starts through the input of an arbitrary point in the
 volume and then tracks in both directions e.g.
 forward and backwards.
 The interesting part with these tracking methods is how they decide when
 to stop tracking.
 FACT is using a single threshold variable 
\begin_inset Formula $R={\displaystyle \sum_{i}^{s}\sum_{j}^{s}|\mathbf{e}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{e}_{j}|/s(s-1)}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is the number of neighbouring voxels and
\family roman
\series medium
\shape up
\size normal
\emph off
\bar no
\noun off
\color none
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}$
\end_inset

 is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue in each point.

\family default
\series default
\shape default
\size default
\emph default
\bar default
\noun default
\color inherit
 The simplest case for defining a neighbourhood of a voxel is to use all
 26 other adjacent (touching) voxels.
 Now, lets think of how 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 will behave in different neighbours.
 When adjacent fibres are aligned strongly 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 will increase as the absolute value of the dot product grows bigger as
 the normalised vectors become more co-linear.
 On the other side, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 will grow shorter in regions without continuity in fibre direction, where
 
\family roman
\series medium
\shape up
\size normal
\emph off
\bar no
\noun off
\color none

\begin_inset Formula $R=0$
\end_inset

 in perfect isotropic conditions.
 In voxels with 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 less than a prespecified threshold e.g.
 0.8 the tracks will stop being followed and FACT will terminate.

\series default

 An important problem with FACT is that it fails to track axons leaving
 major pathways where it tracks only one of the branches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another popular deterministic approach very much inspired by the field of
 fluid dynamics was introduced by Basser 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BPP+00"

\end_inset

 assuming again a continuous vector field but now the tract is generated
 by the solution of a system of differential equations subject to an initial
 condition, the position of the seed point.
 The solution of the system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) is
 given by an iterative method called 
\begin_inset Formula $4^{th}$
\end_inset

order Runge-Kutta scheme.
 (Other schemes are possible.) Here the authors propose that a fibre can
 be represented by a 3D curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}$
\end_inset

 parametrised by the arc length 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 of the track.
 The iterative solution of this equation 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mathbf{r}/ds=\mathbf{e}$
\end_inset

 generates the trajectory of the underlying fibre also known as streamline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basser's method again is very sensitive in local noise and smoothing.
 However, it is very straightforward and fast.
 Wedeen et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WWS+08"

\end_inset

 showed that one could derive the local orientation field of vectors 
\family roman
\series medium
\shape up
\size normal
\emph off
\bar no
\noun off
\color none

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}$
\end_inset

 from the local maxima of the ODF calculated in each voxel.
 In that way we could visualise crossing distributions and depict crossing
 fibres.

 show that, using Fourier reconstruction or Funk-Radon analysis on q-space
 shells, we can generate much richer estimates of axonal architecture than
 SDT models i.e.
 many more fibres of complex or simple configuration.
 This investigation suggests that diffusion MRI with sufficient signal to
 noise ratio (SNR) could make tractography a mathematically well-posed problem.
 However, we need many hours of scanning to reach the necessary resolution.

 A recent deterministic algorithm called Tensorlines
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "weinstein1999tad"

\end_inset

 shares the problems of the other deterministic algorithms by failing in
 relatively sharp turns and Meyer's Loop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the deterministic algorithms generate paths by making a series
 of discrete locally optimum decisions.
 These are fast, simple and easy to interpret.
 Usually, we depict them using streamlines.
 A streamline is a curve that is always tangent to the velocity vector of
 the flow.
 The disadvantages of deterministic algorithms are that a pathway either
 exists or not (no uncertainty) and that they do not explore the entire
 space of likely white matter tracts.
 In other words, local thresholding makes our tractography vulnerable to
 small noise aberrations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probabilistic tractography is meant to deal with this problem and generate
 tracks even in regions that tracking is unclear.
 This is possible by assuming that uncertainty exists concerning the orientation
 of the fibre at each point of the track.
 We will try to illustrate the difference between the two approaches using
 a simplified 2D example shown in Fig.

 Generalising afterwards in 3D is straightforward.

 yellow line shows the result of deterministic tractography which is given
 by a single trajectory and in (ii) is given by connectivity matrix depicting
 with red the probability of different pathways throughout the hole slice.
 Here only 3 possible pathways are depicted for the ease of understanding.
 Finally, in (iii) an example is given where it shows that probabilistic
 tractography weights more closer connections.
 However it can tract further deep than deterministic tractography.

\begin_layout Standard
Let's imagine that we have a 2D slice where in each pixel we have calculated
 a vector showing the primary direction for that specific pixel.
 This vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}$
\end_inset

 could have been calculated from the tensor as the primer eigenvector or
 as a primer direction of a different model e.g.
 the maximum point of the ODF.
 Lets now think that we want to find the best path from seed A to seed Z.
 When using deterministic tractography we are using only the local direction
 information in every pixel therefore in a direction field as this of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:deterministic_probabilistic"

\end_inset

(i) we will have to use only one track and this is the diagonal pathway
 with yellow colour.
 However there are other possible tracts as well in this diagram e.g rather
 than taking the diagonal go first up north from A and then right.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probabilistic tractography aims to identify all the possible tracts by assigning
 to each one of them a weight.
 All the weights of all the tracts together sum to 1.
 This is possible by generating samples from a probability distribution
 for every pixel.
 In this toy example shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:deterministic_probabilistic"

\end_inset

(ii) the orientation of the blue vectors can be represented by a single
 parameter, angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 here is a random variable that takes values from a probability distribution
 function (pdf).
 Now we have many possible directions to move next but with different probabilit
ies.
 The weights of all directions again sum to 1.
 After this explanation we can identify in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:deterministic_probabilistic"

\end_inset

(ii) that the most likely tract is again the diagonal (with deep red) but
 there are other pathways (with lighter red) that are less likely.
 In the same diagram we show with 3 combined red arrows some of the many
 directions that are possible in each point.
 However, some are more certain than others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's try now to understand how a tract is valued as more probable than
 others.
 In Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:deterministic_probabilistic"

\end_inset

(iii) we have drawn a very simple image with only two pixel rows and we
 are assuming that the probability of moving along the primary direction
 (shown with blue arrow) is 0.9 and there is only a secondary direction given
 by 0.1 (1-0.9) i.e.
 we assume for ease of understanding here only 2 directions.
 We can see that there is a discontinuity in position K.
 In that point an Euler based deterministic approach would have to stop
 at K (see yellow line).
 The probabilistic method will continue tracking and it will generate two
 tracts that both reach the target.
 To probability of each tract is calculated by multiplying the probability
 of a specific direction of each point.
 Therefore, the shorter and dark red path will have 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{s}=0.9^{7}\times0.1$
\end_inset

 and the longer and lighter red path will have 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}=0.9^{10}$
\end_inset

.
 It is obvious that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{s}>p_{l}$
\end_inset

 and that the darker red path is more likely to exist according to this
 method.

\begin_layout Standard
Although the probabilistic methods are able to identify many known tracts,
 they miss several large tracts such as the visual pathways LGN-MT and callosal
 MT.
 The visual pathways are useful frameworks for algorithmic development and
 testing because they diverge and bend significantly.
 The current methods have the advantages that they expand the track search
 space beyond deterministic algorithms and that they can easily expand with
 complex models supporting crossings (usually not more than 2 crossings).
 However, they don't compute an accurate probability of brain connections.
 The phraseology

 can be very misleading because someone might believe that they represent
 the actual connectivity profile of the subject.
 For example we are certain (with probability 1) that LGN (lateral geniculate
 nucleus) is connected to V1 and V2 (primary visual cortex) in a healthy
 brain however the estimated connection probability in FDT is much less
 than 1.
 In addition, current probabilistic algorithms fail to identify pathways
 even when they are known to exist or in a few cases they generate pathways
 even when they do not exist

In 2008 Sherbondy
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 in order to try to deal with the problems explained in the previous paragraph
 implemented in ConTrack an algorithm that separates the pathway sampling
 and scoring steps.
 In that way the scoring does not depend any more one whether we are tracking
 from seed A to seed B or from B to A therefore, it assumes symmetry when
 the other probabilistic methods do not.
 At the same time Sherbondy's method assumes independence between different
 tracts i.e.
 path 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow B$
\end_inset

 is independent from 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow C$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $K\rightarrow L$
\end_inset

.
 This is not happening in most other methods where the pathways depend on
 other pathways starting from the same seed.
 So, ConTrack is designed to estimate connections that are known to exist.
 The disadvantage of Sherbondy's method is that it needs a lot of user interacti
on to add the known tracks and the user needs to be a specialist in white
 matter anatomy otherwise the results might be biased.
 The same problem exists with the waypoint masks used in the latest versions
 of FDT.
 Finally, a small summary of the comparative strengths of deterministic
 vs.
 probabilistic tractography is given in Table

Software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We write our software in Python with embedded C/C++ modules for speed if
 necessary.
 We choose Python because it is open source, multiplatform, free, it has
 a very simple object oriented syntax and many interfaces with GUIs, scientific
 computing libraries and other languages.
 We also hope that some of our code will be used in a future version of
 Nipy.
 We coined the name Tractarian (TRN) for this python project but there are
 many functions and files that are useful not only for tractography but
 generally for machine learning, scientific visualisation and medical imaging.
 TRN consists of the following modules diffusion.py, art.py, lights.py, form.py,
 eyes.py and external.py.
 See Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tbl:trn"

\end_inset

 for a summary of their features.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In more detail lights module is using underneath the Visualisation Toolkit
 (VTK) library provides simple commands to generate cones, tori, cubes,
 points, point clouds(dots), spheres, lines, poly-lines, trajectories, labels,
 arrows, planes, axes, splines, surfaces, volumes, record snapshot, record
 video, wireframe surfaces and spherical grids with evenly distributed points.
 For some results see Fig.

A-E.
 Lights enable as well two types of multithreaded interaction a.
 a graphical user interface using wxWindows and the 3d interaction that
 enables the user to translate the volumes and other primitives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The diffusion module calculates at the moment the SDT (tensorfitsimple)
 and generates FA results.
 The future version of diffusion will be able to generate probabilistic
 tracts.
 The eyes module is an alternative visualisation module that enables very
 fast tractography representation and interaction.
 Imagine that the datasets we have contain hundreds of thousands of trajectories.
 To be able to depict them and interact with them in a user friendly speed
 is a difficult problem, see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fig:Lights"

\end_inset

D.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The form module loads and writes many different types of files.
 For example Nifti, Analyze, Dicom, files with diffusion gradient directions
 (bvecs) and b-values (bvals), DTK tractography files e.g.
 trk files and also reads Excel files.
 It has also the possibility to compress and decompress files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The art module is related with the development and testing of new artificial
 intelligence or machine learning algorithms and the use of existing ones.
 At the moment art uses the Modular Toolkit (MDP) e.g.
 to generate FastICA and Scipy for optimisation & integration methods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the external module is used mainly as an alternative of bash scripting
 calling different external tools.
 For example it can generate tractography using DTK, convert files using
 mri_convert, find files, list directories etc.
 In the near future we plan to wrap FSL, Camino and Freesurfer commands.

Applying Fractional Anisotropy to a clinical dataset 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During our journey on understanding the underlying theory behind dMRI methods
 we had to spend a lot of time trying to figure out the merits and deficits
 of the classical SDT approaches using Fractional Anisoropy (FA) volumes
 (presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Diffusion-Maths"

\end_inset

).
 In the next paragraph we present some interesting results we had during
 this investigation.
 
\end_layout

Trichotillomania
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Trichotillomania is a disease with the symptom of impulsive hair pulling.
 It is also a disease that very little imaging data have been published.
 Chamberlain et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "chamberlain2008gma"

\end_inset

 showed grey matter abnormalities in anterior congulate cortex and pre SMA.
 In collaboration with Adam Hampshire from MRC-CBU we tried to confirm and
 extend this result using diffusion imaging.
 The quality of the datasets was not good enough to generate tractography
 but they were good enough to calculate and analyse fractional anisotropy
 (FA) images.
 We found 3 clusters of lowered FA in the trichotillomania group compared
 with controls.
 A white matter cluster under the preSMA and ACC, mostly in the right hemisphere
, another white matter cluster under the left hemisphere in the hand area
 of the pre motor cortex and a large cluster in left hemisphere that spread
 from underneath the pre motor cortex.
 These results are planned to be published at the Journal of American Psychiatry.
 My contribution was mainly on planning the diffusion analysis and visualising
 the datasets using our new software TRN.
 In the beginning we tried to use FSL for all the analysis however we had
 better results when combined FSL, SPM & CAMBA.
 This was inspired by a previous work of Chamberlain et al.
 with an OCD study

The dataset included 20 patients with trichotillomania and 20 matched controls.
 Data collected at the MRIS in Addenbrooks on the 1.5 T GE Signa scanner
 using 25 gradient directions and one volume with b=0.
 MPRAGE was also collected.
 More information about the acquisition protocol and parameters can be found
 here

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eddy correction and calculations of FA maps carried out in FSL/FDT and followed
 the standard on line directions.
 Then, for each participant, the b0 was co-registered with the MPRAGE and
 this transform was applied to the FA maps.
 The MPRAGE was co-registered and normalised to the MNI template in SPM5
 and these parameters were applied to the FA maps.
 The FA maps were now in the same space as the MNI template in SPM5.
 A spatial smooth was applied to the FA maps in SPM 5 using an 8mm Gaussian
 kernel.
 Group level analysis were carried out in CAMBA using cluster level correction.
 A white matter mask was obtained (from Sam Chamberlains previous OCD study).
 This white matter mask was defined by binarising the Statistical Parametric
 Mapping a priori white matter template to a binary mask, i.e., thresholding
 each voxel at 50% white matter to define white matter regions for analysis.
 FA maps were then compared cross group and within the white matter mask
 using a threshold of p < 1 false positive and two tailed cluster analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the visualisation of the results we used Freesurfer to extract the cortical
 surface from the MNI template.
 Then we used our own TRN software for the visualisation.
 The cortical surface was plotted using surface and contour rendering and
 the FA clusters were plotted inside the cortical surface using volumetric
 rendering.

.
 We are now under the process with Dr.
 Adam Hampshire of making this graphical process automated so we can use
 it in all our following analyses that combine volumetric with surface data.
 The difficult part usually to achieve this is how to register these two
 datasets together.
 However, this is high too technical and complicated for this report.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are running a larger cohort during Autumn 2009 with higher resolution
 sequence and we will also be collecting functional fMRI data in this patient
 group for the first time.
 We plan to identify functional differences and generate beautiful and hopefully
 meaningful tracts that will confirm our FA results.

Tractography Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we discuss about some very motivating results we have obtained using
 our new tractography optimised acquisitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
HARDI Experiments in CBU
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default Siemens diffusion acquisition protocol that we are using in
 CBU uses a rectangular voxel size of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.8\times1.8\times2.5\, mm$
\end_inset

.
 We found that this creates problems with many different tractography software
 e.g.
 DSI Studio developed by Fang-Cheng Yeh.
 Tractography algorithms prefer cubic voxel size because that simplifies
 the modelling, clustering and interpolation of the tracts.
 This change would simplify as well our free model ideas described in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Future-Plan"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, we were planning to test the accuracy of tractography using
 acquisitions with different b-values.
 After some fruitful discussions with Dr.
 Guy Williams and Dr.
 Christian Schwarzbauer we decided to run 4 acquisition schemes using 2
 subjects and some fruits.
 All acquisitions were held in our own MRC-CBU's Siemens Trio scanner.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first acquisition (1A) was using the following parameters: voxel size
 
\begin_inset Formula $2.0\times2.0\times2.0\, mm$
\end_inset

, 64 directions, slice thickness 
\begin_inset Formula $2.0\, mm$
\end_inset

, TR=9200 ms, TE=93 ms, FoV read 256 mm and b-value=
\begin_inset Formula $1000\, s/mm^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 One more volume was acquired with b-value = 
\begin_inset Formula $0\, s/mm^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The total duration of the experiment was 10 minutes and 27 seconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second acquisition (2A) was exactly the same with the previous one but
 using b-value = 
\begin_inset Formula $3000\, s/mm^{2}$
\end_inset

, TR=10600 ms and TE= 114 ms.
 The total duration was 12 min and 27 sec.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third acquisition (3A) was the same with the previous two but using
 b-value = 
\begin_inset Formula $5000\, s/mm^{2}$
\end_inset

, TR=11500 ms and TE = 127 ms.
 The total duration was 13 min and 4 sec.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the first three acquisitions were using 64 directions but the fourth
 one (4A) was using 12 directions with b-value 
\begin_inset Formula $5000\, s/mm^{2}$
\end_inset

 and the following parameters: TR=11500 ms, TE=127 ms, Averages=5.

Unfortunately, the scanner failed to run 3A and 4A because of overheating
 problems.

 because in that way we will be able to use algorithms that provide very
 detailed tractography e.g.

First priority at the moment is to start implementing our idea for obtaining
 more information from the actual diffusion signals in each voxel (model
 free approach avoiding the tensor, multi-tensor and ODF approaches) and
 use it in a global fashion to denoise our data.
 We know that in a voxel we can have a nearly infinite number of configurations
 and patterns.
 However we believe that with a multidimensional histogram analysis and
 dimensionality reduction we can find some basic patterns.
 For a simplified 2D example look Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "Fig:Crossings"

\end_inset

.
 In summary, what we will try to do is a local voxel-based clustering of
 the signal configurations.
 In order to reduce the configuration search space we are planning to try
 first linear dimensionality reduction e.g.
 PCA and nonlinear dimensionality reduction e.g.

It is important here to note that every configuration is not deterministic
 but probabilistic enabling for the possibility of errors.
 Error correction and denoising will be used in a neighbourhood level simultaneo
usly in the hole brain data using discrete optimisation.
 The discrete optimisation algorithm that we are planning to use is based
 on the seminal work of Vladimir Kolmogorov

 The mathematics of CT have many similarities with these of dMRI therefore
 there is huge potential for algorithmic sharing.

After the denoising of our datasets we will try to implement probabilistic
 tracts which embed prior knowledge in a Bayesian fashion.
 For example in normal healthy brains there will always be an actual optic
 radiation underlying our datasets.
 Could we use this information in a Bayesian way? This idea was inspired
 by the work of Sherbondy et al

 We are already half way through.
 The paper is planned to be published at the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience

 who would like to understand the basics of graph and network theory for
 dMRI connectivity analysis.
 Hopefully, this paper will finish before the end of September 2009.

 data very close to the resolution of DSI.
 This will be the first time that this model is implemented in a real scanner.
 However this acquisition depends on multi-shell data with very high b-values
 up to 10000 and we are waiting from Siemens for an answer if this is eligible
 in our scanner.

2D simplified example of some patterns than can be found in a voxel: a)
 multiple fibre crossing, b) simple fibre crossing, c) diagonal fibre, d)
 horizontal, e) vertical fibre, f) multiple crossing.
 The difference in size between f and a means that f is more likely to be
 an actual crossing because the signal is very low in every direction.
 Low signal in dMRI means higher directionality and less isotropy.
 Therefore, a is more isotropic than f i.e.
 f is more likely to be a fiber crossing than a.
 This is a fact not used at the moment in any other tractography methods.

Final year
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the final year we will concentrate more on finding tracts that are similar
 across different subjects.
 Similarity parameters could be the length, curvature, thickness, torsion,
 distribution of thickness and others.
 In that way we hope to find solid landmarks that we can use to effectively
 co-register the subjects using tractography information and not classic
 FA as in FSL/TBSS.

We are also planning to acquire some synthetic or biological phantoms to
 validate our algorithms.
 For example Perrin et al.
 studied a complex phantom made from crossing hemodialysis fibres 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 We share already some diffusion software phantoms (depicting DNA helices)
 obtained from UCLA.
 Unfortunately, global standard validation tools for dMRI are not available
 widely and this is a problem that we are trying to investigate.
 Roebroeck et al.

 the best tissue-based crossing fibre.

 Freesurfer and try to use the information from tractography to segment/parcella

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the first PhD course in MRC-CBU that is concentrated in diffusion
 MRI.
 Most of the time until this day was spent on understanding the theory,
 using the existing tools and making links and collaborations with other
 researchers who are more proficient in the field e.g.
 Dr.
 Williams on diffusion acquisitions and Dr.Melie-Garcia on connectivity analysis
 and graph theory.
 We had also progress developing our own software library in Python named
 TRN.
 TRN at the moment is able to calculate simple tensors, read and convert
 many different medical files, generate very complex graphics e.g.
 4D density plots and many more options as described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Software"

\end_inset

.
 We also analysed diffusion datasets using many different tools e.g.
 TrackVis, DTK, FSL, CAMBA, DSI Studio, Brain Visa, SPM and generated cortical
 surfaces using Freesurfer.
 We were happy to see lower FA with patients suffering from trichotillomania
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Trichotillomania"

\end_inset

) and also generate extensive tractography implementing a new protocol with
 a cubic voxel size (see Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fig:FACT"

\end_inset

, 2, 11) which hopefully will replace the default Siemens protocol used
 in CBU.
 Our primary concentration for the future is to investigate and implement
 a more meaningful tractography using machine learning and discrete optimisation.
 For this project we collaborate with two researchers from Computer Vision
 Group, Toshiba Research Laboratory in Cambridge, Dr.
 Vogiatzis and Dr.
 Hernández.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we envision tractography to become in the future the gold standard
 for registration of different brain modalities as today is the structural
 MRI and the Tailarach space.
 We also believe that diffusion tractography has a great potential to become
 a non-invasive navigation tool for surgical planning.
 However, current tractography is difficult to validate and visualise and
 can generate ghosts and artifacts.
 We are hoping to contribute the maximum towards the solution of these problems
 in the time left in this course.

\begin_layout Subsection
TBSS 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In collaboration with Dr.
 Boszic we tried to use FSL/TBSS to cor-register many subjects together,
 define the mask in the mean FA image and then using TBSS de-project go
 back to the native diffusion space and do tractography there.
 We tried this idea because it is very time consuming to define seeds in
 every single subject it could take many weeks and it can be very biased.
 So, this automation idea could have reduced our analysis time dramatically.
 Unfortunately, the nonlinear nature of TBSS and the high dependence on
 the skeleton was not able to de-project the masks efficiently i.e.
 many masks were broken.
 We hope that in future versions of TBSS this will be resolved.
