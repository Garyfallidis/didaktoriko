  abstract       = {MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can measure and
                   visualize organization of white matter fibre tracts in
                   vivo. DTI is a relatively new imaging technique, and
                   new tools developed for quantifying fibre tracts
                   require evaluation. The purpose of this study was to
                   compare the reliability of a novel clustering approach
                   with a multiple region of interest (MROI) approach in
                   both healthy and disease (schizophrenia) populations.
                   DTI images were acquired in 20 participants (n=10
                   patients with schizophrenia: 56+/-15 years; n=10
                   controls: 51+/-20 years) (1.5 T GE system) with
                   diffusion gradients applied in 23 non-collinear
                   directions, repeated three times. Whole brain seeding
                   and creation of fibre tracts were then performed.
                   Interrater reliability of the clustering approach, and
                   the MROI approach, were each evaluated and the methods
                   compared. There was high spatial (voxel-based)
                   agreement within and between the clustering and MROI
                   methods. Fractional anisotropy, trace, and radial and
                   axial diffusivity values showed high intraclass
                   correlation (p<0.001 for all tracts) for each approach.
                   Differences in scalar indices of diffusion between the
                   clustering and MROI approach were minimal. The
                   excellent interrater reliability of the clustering
                   method and high agreement with the MROI method,
                   quantitatively and spatially, indicates that the
                   clustering method can be used with confidence. The
                   clustering method avoids biases of ROI drawing and
                   placement, and, not limited by a priori predictions,
                   may be a more robust and efficient way to identify and
                   measure white matter tracts of interest.},

                   (DT-MRI) is noise sensitive, and the noise can induce
                   numerous systematic errors in subsequent parameter
                   calculations. This paper proposes a sparse
                   representation-based method for denoising cardiac
                   DT-MRI images. The method first generates a dictionary
                   of multiple bases according to the features of the
                   observed image. A segmentation algorithm based on
                   nonstationary degree detector is then introduced to
                   make the selection of atoms in the dictionary adapted
                   to the image's features. The denoising is achieved by
                   gradually approximating the underlying image using the
                   atoms selected from the generated dictionary. The
                   results on both simulated image and real cardiac DT-MRI
                   images from ex vivo human hearts show that the proposed
                   denoising method performs better than conventional
                   denoising techniques by preserving image contrast and
                   fine structures.},

                   analysis of diffusion MRI data along white matter fiber
                   tracts. Using subject-specific tractography bundle
                   segmentations, we generate an arc length
                   parameterization of the bundle with point
                   correspondences across all fibers and all subjects,
                   allowing tract-based measurement and analysis. In this
                   paper we present a quantitative comparison of fiber
                   coordinate systems from the literature and we introduce
                   an improved optimal match method that reduces spatial
                   distortion and improves intra- and inter-subject
                   variability of FA measurements. We propose a method for
                   generating arc length correspondences across
                   hemispheres, enabling a TBM study of interhemispheric
                   diffusion asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus (AF)
                   and cingulum bundle (CB). The results of this study
                   demonstrate that TBM can detect differences that may
                   not be found by measuring means of scalar invariants in
                   entire tracts, such as the mean diffusivity (MD)
                   differences found in AF. We report TBM results of
                   higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left
                   hemisphere in AF (caused primarily by lower lambda(3),
                   the smallest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the
                   left AF), and higher left hemisphere FA in CB (related
                   to higher lambda(1), the largest eigenvalue of the
                   diffusion tensor, in the left CB). By mapping the
                   significance levels onto the tractography trajectories
                   for each structure, we demonstrate the anatomical
                   locations of the interhemispheric differences. The TBM
                   approach brings analysis of DTI data into the
                   clinically and neuroanatomically relevant framework of
                   the tract anatomy.},

                   fundamental steps in understanding the anatomy of the
                   human brain. The white matter has been structurally
                   defined in the past only at its core regions (deep
                   white matter). However, the most peripheral white
                   matter areas, which are interleaved between the cortex
                   and the deep white matter, have lacked clear anatomical
                   definitions and parcellations. We used axonal fiber
                   alignment information from diffusion tensor imaging
                   (DTI) to delineate the peripheral white matter, and
                   investigated its relationship with the cortex and the
                   deep white matter. Using DTI data from 81 healthy
                   subjects, we identified nine common, blade-like
                   anatomical regions, which were further parcellated into
                   21 subregions based on the cortical anatomy. Four short

                   with short gradient durations and imaging times.
                   Although the DW-SSFP signal is well characterized for
                   isotropic, Gaussian diffusion, it is unclear how the
                   DW-SSFP signal propagates in inhomogeneous media such
                   as brain tissue. This article presents a more general
                   analytical expression for the DW-SSFP signal which
                   accommodates Gaussian and non-Gaussian spin
                   displacement probability density functions. This new
                   framework for calculating the DW-SSFP signal is used to
                   investigate signal behavior for a single fiber,
                   crossing fibers, and reflective barriers. DW-SSFP
                   measurements in the corpus callosum of a fixed brain

                   predictions. Further measurements in fixed brain tissue
                   also demonstrate that 3D DW-SSFP out-performs 3D
                   diffusion weighted spin echo in both SNR and CNR
                   efficiency providing a compelling example of its

                   the currently available methods of fibre tracking is
                   the reconstruction of long neuronal pathways in small
                   successive steps by following the local, voxel-defined
                   fibre direction. Starting from local information on the
                   diffusivity, long-distance connections are determined.
                   This method is inherently prone to instability, since a
                   mistake at a single crossing affects radically the
                   final result. In this paper we present a method based
                   on a new principle. Instead of walking successively
                   through the volume all neuronal pathways and the
                   totality of the signal is taken into account at the
                   same time. This novel approach is capable to

                   brain region has a specific connection profile to
                   create parcellations of the cortical mantle using MR
                   diffusion imaging. The parcellation is performed in two
                   steps. First, the cortical mantle is split at a
                   macroscopic level into 36 large gyri using a sulcus
                   recognition system. Then, for each voxel of the cortex,
                   a connection profile is computed using a probabilistic
                   tractography framework. The tractography is performed
                   from q fields using regularized particle trajectories.
                   Fiber ODF are inferred from the q-balls using a
                   sharpening process focusing the weight around the
                   q-ball local maxima. A sophisticated mask of
                   propagation computed from a T1-weighted image perfectly
                   aligned with the diffusion data prevents the particles
                   from crossing the cortical folds. During propagation,
                   the particles father child particles in order to
                   improve the sampling of the long fascicles. For each
                   voxel, intersection of the particle trajectories with
                   the gyri lead to a connectivity profile made up of only
                   36 connection strengths. These profiles are clustered
                   on a gyrus by gyrus basis using a K-means approach

                   of the results is studied for three subjects using

                   tensor model is its limited ability to provide detailed
                   information about multidirectional fiber architecture
                   within a voxel. This leads to erroneous fiber
                   tractography results in locations where fiber bundles
                   cross each other. This may lead to the inability to
                   visualize clinically important tracts such as the
                   lateral projections of the corticospinal tract. In this
                   report, we present a deterministic two-tensor eXtended
                   Streamline Tractography (XST) technique, which
                   successfully traces through regions of crossing fibers.
                   We evaluated the method on simulated and in vivo human
                   brain data, comparing the results with the traditional
                   single-tensor and with a probabilistic tractography
                   technique. By tracing the corticospinal tract and
                   correlating with fMRI-determined motor cortex in both
                   healthy subjects and patients with brain tumors, we
                   demonstrate that two-tensor deterministic streamline
                   tractography can accurately identify fiber bundles
                   consistent with anatomy and previously not detected by
                   conventional single-tensor tractography. When compared
                   to the dense connectivity maps generated by
                   probabilistic tractography, the method is
                   computationally efficient and generates discrete
                   geometric pathways that are simple to visualize and
                   clinically useful. Detection of crossing white matter

                   tensor magnetic resonance imaging ({DTI}) tractography
                   derived from the second order diffusion tensor model
                   has limitations in its ability to resolve complex fiber
                   tracts. We propose a new fiber tracking method based on
                   the generalized diffusion tensor ({GDT}) model. This
                   new method better models the anisotropic diffusion
                   process in human brain by using the generalized
                   diffusion simulation-based fiber tractography ({GDST}).
                   Due to the additional information provided by {GDT},
                   the {GDST} method simulates the underlying physical
                   diffusion process of the human brain more accurately
                   than does the standard {DTI} method. The effectiveness
                   of the new fiber tracking algorithm was demonstrated
                   via analyses on real and synthetic {DWI} datasets. In
                   addition, the general analytic expression of high order
                   b matrix is derived in the case of twice refocused
                   spin-echo ({TRSE}) pulse sequence which is used in the

                   imaging (DTI) cannot directly image multiple fiber

                   image crossing fibers in neural tissue. DSI was
                   performed in formalin-fixed brains of adult macaque and
                   in the brains of healthy human subjects. Fiber tract
                   solutions were constructed by a streamline procedure,
                   following directions of maximum diffusion at every
                   point, and analyzed in an interactive visualization
                   environment (TrackVis). We report that DSI tractography
                   accurately shows the known anatomic fiber crossings in
                   optic chiasm, centrum semiovale, and brainstem; fiber
                   intersections in gray matter, including cerebellar
                   folia and the caudate nucleus; and radial fiber
                   architecture in cerebral cortex. In contrast, none of
                   these examples of fiber crossing and complex structure
                   was identified by DTI analysis of the same data sets.
                   These findings indicate that DSI tractography is able
                   to image crossing fibers in neural tissue, an essential
                   step toward non-invasive imaging of connectional
                   neuroanatomy.},

                   effective way to report anatomic locations of interest
                   and to perform anatomic quantification. However,
                   existing stereotaxic atlases lack comprehensive
                   coordinate information about white matter structures.
                   In this paper, white matter-specific atlases in
                   stereotaxic coordinates are introduced. As a reference
                   template, the widely used ICBM-152 was used. The atlas
                   contains fiber orientation maps and hand-segmented
                   white matter parcellation maps based on diffusion
                   tensor imaging (DTI). Registration accuracy by linear
                   and non-linear transformation was measured, and
                   automated template-based white matter parcellation was
                   tested. The results showed a high correlation between
                   the manual ROI-based and the automated approaches for
                   normal adult populations. The atlases are freely
                   available and believed to be a useful resource as a
                   target template and for automated parcellation methods.

                   vivo is white matter fiber tractography that uses
                   magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging. The
                   success of this method depends strongly on the
                   capability of the applied tracking algorithm and the
                   quality of the underlying data set. However, DTI-based
                   fiber tractography still lacks standardized validation.
                   In the present work, a combined fMRI/DTI study was
                   performed, both to develop a setup for verifying fiber
                   tracking results using fMRI-derived functional
                   connections and to explore the limitations of fMRI
                   based DTI fiber tracking. Therefore, a minor fiber
                   bundle that features several fiber crossings and
                   intersections was examined: The striatum and its
                   connections to the primary motor cortex were examined
                   by using two approaches to derive the somatotopic
                   organization of the striatum. First, an fMRI-based
                   somatotopic map of the striatum was reconstructed,
                   based on fMRI activations that were provoked by
                   unilateral motor tasks. Second, fMRI-guided DTI fiber
                   tracking was performed to generate DTI-based
                   somatotopic maps, using a standard line propagation and
                   an advanced fast marching algorithm. The results show
                   that the fiber connections reconstructed by the
                   advanced fast marching algorithm are in good agreement
                   with known anatomy, and that the DTI-revealed
                   somatotopy is similar to the fMRI somatotopy.
                   Furthermore, the study illustrates that the combination
                   of fMRI with DTI can supply additional information in
                   order to choose reasonable seed regions for generating
                   functionally relevant networks and to validate
                   reconstructed fibers.},

  abstract       = {We present a novel approach for joint clustering and
                   point-by-point mapping of white matter fiber pathways.
                   Knowledge of the point correspondence along the fiber
                   pathways is not only necessary for accurate clustering
                   of the trajectories into fiber bundles, but also
                   crucial for any tract-oriented quantitative analysis.
                   We employ an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to
                   cluster the trajectories in a gamma mixture model
                   context. The result of clustering is the probabilistic
                   assignment of the fiber trajectories to each cluster,
                   an estimate of the cluster parameters, i.e. spatial
                   mean and variance, and point correspondences. The fiber
                   bundles are modeled by the mean trajectory and its
                   spatial variation. Point-by-point correspondence of the
                   trajectories within a bundle is obtained by
                   constructing a distance map and a label map from each
                   cluster center at every iteration of the EM algorithm.
                   This offers a time-efficient alternative to pairwise
                   curve matching of all trajectories with respect to each
                   cluster center. The proposed method has the potential
                   to benefit from an anatomical atlas of fiber tracts by
                   incorporating it as prior information in the EM
                   algorithm. The algorithm is also capable of handling
                   outliers in a principled way. The presented results
                   confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the
                   proposed framework for quantitative analysis of
                   diffusion tensor MRI.},

                   examing the 3D displacement profile of water molecules
                   in brain tissue. By applying diffusion-sensitizing
                   gradients along a minimum of 6 directions, second-order
                   tensors can be computed to model dominant diffusion
                   processes. However, it has been shown that conventional
                   DTI is not sufficient to resolve crossing fiber tracts.
                   More recently, High Angular Resolution Diffusion
                   Imaging (HARDI) seeks to address this issue by
                   employing more than 6 gradient directions. In this
                   paper, we introduce the Tensor Distribution Function
                   (TDF), a probability function defined on the space of
                   symmetric and positive definite matrices. Here, fiber
                   crossing is modeled as an ensemble of Gaussian
                   diffusion processes with weights specified by the TDF.
                   Once this optimal TDF is determined, ODF can easily be
                   computed by analytic integration of the resulting
                   displacement probability function. Moreover, principal
                   fiber directions can also be directly derived from the
                   TDF.},

                   challenge in neuroscience. However, direct evidence for
                   anatomical connectivity networks in the human brain
                   remains scarce. Here, we utilized diffusion tensor
                   imaging deterministic tractography to construct a
                   macroscale anatomical network capturing the underlying
                   common connectivity pattern of human cerebral cortex in
                   a large sample of subjects (80 young adults) and
                   further quantitatively analyzed its topological
                   properties with graph theoretical approaches. The
                   cerebral cortex was divided into 78 cortical regions,
                   each representing a network node, and 2 cortical
                   regions were considered connected if the probability of
                   fiber connections exceeded a statistical criterion. The
                   topological parameters of the established cortical
                   network (binarized) resemble that of a "small-world"
                   architecture characterized by an exponentially
                   truncated power-law distribution. These characteristics
                   imply high resilience to localized damage. Furthermore,
                   this cortical network was characterized by major hub
                   regions in association cortices that were connected by
                   bridge connections following long-range white matter
                   pathways. Our results are compatible with previous
                   structural and functional brain networks studies and

                   information. Studies in this field have so far been
                   limited mainly to the correction of miniscule
                   physiological motion. In order to correct for gross
                   patient motion it is not sufficient to correct for
                   misregistration between successive shots; the change in
                   the diffusion-encoding direction must also be accounted
                   for. This becomes particularly important for multishot
                   sequences, whereby—in the presence of motion—each shot
                   is encoded with a different diffusion weighting. In
                   this study a general mathematical framework to correct
                   for gross patient motion present in a multishot and

                   presented that includes the effect of rotational and

                   This model was used to create a nonlinear leastsquares
                   formulation, from which the diffusion tensors were
                   obtained using a nonlinear conjugate gradient
                   algorithm. Applications to both phantom simulations and
                   in vivo studies showed that in the case of gross motion
                   the proposed algorithm performs superiorly compared to
                   conventional methods used for tensor estimation.},

                   processes and affects a wide range of practical
                   applications. Previous measurements of the pulsed
                   gradient stimulated echo (PGSTE) signal attenuation,
                   E(q), of water within nerves and impermeable
                   cylindrical microcapillary tubes showed it to be
                   exquisitely sensitive to the orientation of the applied
                   wave vector, q, with respect to the tube axis in the
                   high-q regime. Here, we provide a simple
                   three-dimensional model to explain this angular
                   dependence by decomposing the average propagator, which
                   describes the net displacement of water molecules, into
                   components parallel and perpendicular to the tube wall,
                   in which axial diffusion is free and radial diffusion
                   is restricted. The model faithfully predicts the
                   experimental data, not only the observed diffraction
                   peaks in E(q) when the diffusion gradients are
                   approximately normal to the tube wall, but their sudden
                   disappearance when the gradient orientation possesses a
                   small axial component. The model also successfully
                   predicts the dependence of E(q) on gradient pulse
                   duration and on gradient strength as well as tube inner
                   diameter. To account for the deviation from the narrow
                   pulse approximation in the PGSTE sequence, we use
                   Callaghan’s matrix operator framework, which this study
                   validates experimentally for the first time. We also
                   show how to combine average propagators derived for
                   classical one-dimensional and two-dimensional models of
                   restricted diffusion (e.g. between plates, within
                   cylinders) to construct composite three-dimensional
                   models of diffusion in complex media containing pores
                   (e.g. rectangular prisms and/ or capped cylinders)
                   having a distribution of orientations, sizes, and
                   aspect ratios. This three-dimensional modeling
                   framework should aid in describing diffusion in
                   numerous biological systems and in a myriad of
                   materials sciences applications.},

                   algorithm (ConTrack) that identifies the most likely
                   pathways between two regions. We introduce the
                   algorithm in three parts: a sampler to generate a large
                   set of potential pathways, a scoring algorithm that
                   measures the likelihood of a pathway, and an
                   inferential step to identify the most likely pathways
                   connecting two regions. In a series of experiments
                   using human data, we show that ConTrack estimates known
                   pathways at positions that are consistent with those
                   found using a high quality deterministic algorithm.
                   Further we show that separating sampling and scoring
                   enables ConTrack to identify valid pathways, known to
                   exist, that are missed by other deterministic and
                   probabilistic DFT algorithms.},

                   characterize the intravoxel anisotropy based on
                   diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The proposed
                   solution, under a fully Bayesian formalism, deals with
                   the problem of joint Bayesian Model selection and
                   parameter estimation to reconstruct the principal
                   diffusion profiles or primary fiber orientations in a
                   voxel. We develop an efficient stochastic algorithm
                   based on the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo
                   (RJMCMC) method in order to perform the Bayesian
                   computation. RJMCMC is a good choice for this problem
                   because of its ability to jump between models of
                   different dimensionality. This methodology provides
                   posterior estimates of the parameters of interest
                   (fiber orientation, diffusivities etc) unconditional of
                   the model assumed. It also gives an empirical posterior
                   distribution of the number of primary nerve fiber
                   orientations given the DWI data. Different probability
                   maps can be assessed using this methodology: 1) the
                   intravoxel fiber orientation map (or orientational
                   distribution function) that gives the probability of
                   finding a fiber in a particular spatial orientation; 2)
                   a three-dimensional map of the probability of finding a
                   particular number of fibers in each voxel; 3) a
                   three-dimensional MaxPro (maximum probability) map that
                   provides the most probable number of fibers for each
                   voxel. In order to study the performance and
                   reliability of the presented approach, we tested it on
                   synthetic data; an ex-vivo phantom of intersecting
                   capillaries; and DWI data from a human subject.},

                   modality that can reveal detailed anatomy of the white
                   matter. DTI also allows us to approximate the 3D
                   trajectories of major white matter bundles. By
                   combining the identified tract coordinates with various
                   types of MR parameter maps, such as T2 and diffusion
                   properties, we can perform tract-specific analysis of
                   these parameters. Unfortunately, 3D tract
                   reconstruction is marred by noise, partial volume
                   effects, and complicated axonal structures.
                   Furthermore, changes in diffusion anisotropy under
                   pathological conditions could alter the results of 3D
                   tract reconstruction. In this study, we created a white
                   matter parcellation atlas based on probabilistic maps
                   of 11 major white matter tracts derived from the DTI

                   fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were
                   performed. Excellent correlation was found between the

                   results. This tool allows efficient initial screening

                   segmentation based on the multi-channel fusion of
                   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. The method is
                   motivated by the evidence that independent tissue
                   segmentation based on DTI parametric images provides
                   complementary information of tissue contrast to the
                   tissue segmentation based on structural MRI data. This
                   has important applications in defining accurate tissue
                   maps when fusing structural data with diffusion data.
                   In the absence of structural data, tissue segmentation
                   based on DTI data provides an alternative means to
                   obtain brain tissue segmentation. Our approach to the
                   tissue segmentation based on DTI data is to classify
                   the brain into two compartments by utilizing the tissue
                   contrast existing in a single channel. Specifically,
                   because the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values
                   in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are more than twice
                   that of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), we use
                   ADC images to distinguish CSF and non-CSF tissues.
                   Additionally, fractional anisotropy (FA) images are
                   used to separate WM from non-WM tissues, as highly
                   directional white matter structures have much larger
                   fractional anisotropy values. Moreover, other channels
                   to separate tissue are explored, such as eigenvalues of
                   the tensor, relative anisotropy (RA), and volume ratio
                   (VR). We developed an approach based on the
                   Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation
                   (STAPLE) algorithm that combines these two-class maps
                   to obtain a complete tissue segmentation map of CSF,
                   GM, and WM. Evaluations are provided to demonstrate the
                   performance of our approach. Experimental results of
                   applying this approach to brain tissue segmentation and
                   deformable registration of DTI data and spoiled
                   gradient-echo (SPGR) data are also provided.},

  abstract       = {In this paper, a hybrid discriminative/generative
                   model for brain anatomical structure segmentation is
                   proposed. The learning aspect of the approach is
                   emphasized. In the discriminative appearance models,
                   various cues such as intensity and curvatures are
                   combined to locally capture the complex appearances of
                   different anatomical structures. A probabilistic
                   boosting tree (PBT) framework is adopted to learn
                   multi-class discriminative models that combine hundreds
                   of features across different scales. On the generative
                   side, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shape models
                   are used to capture the global shape information about
                   each anatomical structure. The parameters to combine
                   the discriminative appearance and generative shape
                   models are also automatically learned. Thus low-level
                   and highlevel information is learned and integrated in
                   a hybrid model. Segmentations are obtained by
                   minimizing an energy function associated with the
                   proposed hybrid model. Finally, a gridface structure is
                   designed to explicitly represent the 3D region
                   topology. This representation handles an arbitrary
                   number of regions and facilitates fast surface
                   evolution. Our system was trained and tested on a set
                   of 3D MRI volumes and the results obtained are
                   encouraging.},

  abstract       = {Diffusion MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that
                   allows the measurement of water molecule diffusion
                   through tissue in vivo. The directional features of
                   water diffusion allow one to infer the connectivity
                   patterns prevalent in tissue and possibly track changes
                   in this connectivity over time for various clinical
                   applications. In this paper, we present a novel
                   statistical model for diffusion-weighted MR signal
                   attenuation which postulates that the water molecule
                   diffusion can be characterized by a continuous mixture
                   of diffusion tensors. An interesting observation is
                   that this continuous mixture and the MR signal
                   attenuation are related through the Laplace transform
                   of a probability distribution over symmetric positive
                   definite matrices. We then show that when the mixing
                   distribution is a Wishart distribution, the resulting
                   closed form of the Laplace transform leads to a
                   Rigaut-type asymptotic fractal expression, which has
                   been phenomenologically used in the past to explain the
                   MR signal decay but never with a rigorous mathematical
                   justification until now. Our model not only includes
                   the traditional diffusion tensor model as a special
                   instance in the limiting case, but also can be adjusted
                   to describe complex tissue structure involving multiple
                   fiber populations. Using this new model in conjunction
                   with a spherical deconvolution approach, we present an
                   efficient scheme for estimating the water molecule
                   displacement probability functions on a voxel-by-voxel
                   basis. Experimental results on both simulations and
                   real data are presented to demonstrate the robustness

                   application field originate from diffusion tensor
                   imaging (DTI), a powerful nuclear magnetic resonance
                   technique which enables the quantification of
                   microscopical tissue properties. The current analysis
                   framework of separate voxelwise regressions is
                   reformulated as a 3D space-varying coefficient model
                   (SVCM) for the entire set of diffusion tensor images
                   recorded on a 3D voxel grid. The SVCM unifies the
                   three-step cascade of standard data processing
                   (voxelwise regression, smoothing, interpolation) into
                   one framework based on B-spline basis functions.
                   Thereby strength is borrowed from spatially correlated
                   voxels to gain a regularization effect right at the
                   estimation stage. Two SVCM variants are conceptualized:
                   a full tensor product approach and a sequential
                   approximation, rendering the SVCM numerically and
                   computationally feasible even for the huge dimension of
                   the joint model in a realistic setup. A simulation
                   study shows that both approaches outperform the
                   standard method of voxelwise regression with subsequent
                   regularization. Application of the fast sequential
                   method to real DTI data demonstrates the inherent
                   ability to increase the grid resolution by evaluating
                   the incorporated basis functions at intermediate
                   points. The resulting continuous regularized tensor
                   field may serve as basis for multiple applications,
                   yet, ameloriation of local adaptivity is desirable. },

                   ordering of gradient directions in diffusion-weighted
                   MRI so that partial scans have the best spherical
                   coverage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diffusion-weighted MRI
                   often uses a spherical sampling scheme, which acquires
                   images sequentially with diffusion-weighting gradients
                   in unique directions distributed isotropically on the
                   hemisphere. If not all of the measurements can be
                   completed, the quality of diffusion tensors fitted to
                   the partial scan is sensitive to the order of the
                   gradient directions in the scanner protocol. If the
                   directions are in a random order, then a partial scan
                   may cover some parts of the hemisphere densely but
                   other parts sparsely and thus provide poor spherical
                   coverage. We compare the results of ordering with
                   previously published methods for optimizing the
                   acquisition in simulation. RESULTS: Results show that
                   all methods produce similar results and all improve the
                   accuracy of the estimated diffusion tensors
                   significantly over unordered acquisitions. CONCLUSION:
                   The new ordering method improves the spherical coverage
                   of partial scans and has the advantage of maintaining
                   the optimal coverage of the complete scan.},

                   with its detailed validation and a discussion on its
                   benefits over the state-of-the-art. Our analytical
                   solution is achieved by modeling the raw high angular
                   resolution diffusion imaging signal with a spherical
                   harmonic basis that incorporates a regularization term
                   based on the Laplace– Beltrami operator defined on the
                   unit sphere. This leads to an elegant mathematical
                   simplification of the Funk–Radon transform which
                   approximates the ODF. We prove a new corollary of the
                   Funk–Hecke theorem to obtain this simplification. Then,
                   we show that the Laplace–Beltrami regularization is
                   theoretically and practically better than Tikhonov
                   regularization. At the cost of slightly reducing
                   angular resolution, the Laplace–Beltrami regularization
                   reduces ODF estimation errors and improves fiber
                   detection while reducing angular error in the ODF
                   maxima detected. Finally, a careful quantitative
                   validation is performed against ground truth from
                   synthetic data and against real data from a biological
                   phantom and a human brain dataset. We show that our
                   technique is also able to recover known fiber crossings
                   in the human brain and provides the practical advantage
                   of being up to 15 times faster than original numerical
                   QBI method.},

                   imaging modalities are used for their delineation in
                   living subjects, but these methods rely on subject
                   cooperation, and many regions of the human brain cannot
                   be activated specifically. Diffusion tractography is a
                   novel tool to identify such areas in the human brain,
                   utilizing underlying white matter pathways to separate

                   for characterizing microstructural changes or
                   differences with neuropathology and treatment. The
                   diffusion tensor may be used to characterize the
                   magnitude, the degree of anisotropy, and the
                   orientation of directional diffusion. This review
                   addresses the biological mechanisms, acquisition, and
                   analysis of DTI measurements. The relationships between
                   DTI measures and white matter pathologic features
                   (e.g., ischemia, myelination, axonal damage,
                   inflammation, and edema) are summarized. Applications
                   of DTI to tissue characterization in neurotherapeutic

                   common DTI measures (mean diffusivity, MD; fractional

                   very specific to the type of changes (e.g., radial or

                   characterize the tissue microstructure, future studies

                   connectivity with both frontal and parietal cortical
                   areas. The borders of their subregions are less well
                   defined in the human brain. Here we use diffusion
                   tractography to identify a reproducible border between
                   dorsal and ventral subregions of human precentral

                   correspondence between our PMd/PMv border and local
                   sulcal and functional anatomy. The location of the

                   divides the inferior precentral sulcus from the
                   superior precentral sulcus and corresponded closely to
                   the location of a functional border defined using

                   point-by-point mapping of white matter fiber pathways
                   is presented. Accurate clustering of the trajectories
                   into fiber bundles requires point correspondence
                   determined along the fiber pathways. This knowledge is
                   also crucial for any tract-oriented quantitative
                   analysis. We employ an expectation-maximization (EM)
                   algorithm to cluster the trajectories in a Gamma
                   mixture model context. The result of clustering is the
                   probabilistic assignment of the fiber trajectories to
                   each cluster, an estimate of the cluster parameters,
                   and point correspondences along the trajectories.
                   Point-by-point correspondence of the trajectories
                   within a bundle is obtained by constructing a distance
                   map and a label map from each cluster center at every
                   iteration of the EM algorithm. This offers a
                   time-efficient alternative to pairwise curve matching
                   of all trajectories with respect to each cluster
                   center. Probabilistic assignment of the trajectories to
                   clusters is controlled by imposing a minimum threshold
                   on the membership probabilities, to remove outliers in
                   a principled way. The presented results confirm the
                   efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework

                   Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) and Graph Theory is
                   presented for characterizing the anatomical connections
                   between brain gray matter areas. In a first step, brain
                   voxels are modeled as nodes of a non-directed graph in
                   which the weight of an arc linking two neighbor nodes
                   is assumed to be proportional to the probability of
                   being connected by nervous fibers. This probability is
                   estimated by means of probabilistic tissue segmentation
                   and intravoxel white matter orientational distribution
                   function, obtained from anatomical MRI and DW-MRI,
                   respectively. A new tractography algorithm for finding
                   white matter routes is also introduced. This algorithm
                   solves the most probable path problem between any two
                   nodes, leading to the assessment of probabilistic brain
                   anatomical connection maps. In a second step, for
                   assessing anatomical connectivity between K gray matter
                   structures, the previous graph is redefined as a K+1
                   partite graph by partitioning the initial nodes set in
                   K non-overlapped gray matter subsets and one subset
                   clustering the remaining nodes. Three different
                   measures are proposed for quantifying anatomical
                   connections between any pair of gray matter subsets:
                   Anatomical Connection Strength (ACS), Anatomical
                   Connection Density (ACD) and Anatomical Connection
                   Probability (ACP). This methodology was applied to both
                   artificial and actual human data. Results show that
                   nervous fiber pathways between some regions of interest
                   were reconstructed correctly. Additionally, mean
                   connectivity maps of ACS, ACD and ACP between 71 gray
                   matter structures for five healthy subjects are

                   (DWI) as a method for examining neural connectivity,
                   its accuracy has not been formally evaluated. In this
                   study, we directly compared connections that were
                   visualized using injected neural tract tracers
                   (WGA-HRP) with those obtained using in-vivo diffusion
                   tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. First, we injected
                   the tracer at multiple sites in the brain of a macaque
                   monkey; second, we reconstructed the histological
                   sections of the labeled fiber tracts in 3D; third, we
                   segmented and registered the fibers (somatosensory and
                   motor tracts) with the anatomical in-vivo MRI from the
                   same animal; and last, we conducted fiber tracing along
                   the same pathways on the DTI data using a classical
                   diffusion tracing technique with the injection sites as
                   seeds. To evaluate the performance of DTI fiber
                   tracing, we compared the fibers derived from the DTI
                   tractography with those segmented from the histology.
                   We also studied the influence of the parameters
                   controlling the tractography by comparing Dice
                   superimposition coefficients between histology and DTI
                   segmentations. While there was generally good visual
                   agreement between the two methods, our quantitative
                   comparisons reveal certain limitations of DTI
                   tractography, particularly for regions at remote
                   locations from seeds. We have thus demonstrated the
                   importance of appropriate settings for realistic

                   has been used to examine the microstructure of
                   individual white matter tracts, often in
                   neuropsychiatric conditions without identifiable focal
                   pathology. However, the voxel-based group-mapping and
                   region-of-interest (ROI) approaches used to analyse the
                   data have inherent conceptual and practical
                   difficulties. Taking the example of the genu of the
                   corpus callosum in a sample of schizophrenic patients,
                   we discuss the difficulties in attempting to replicate
                   a voxel-based finding of reduced anisotropy using two
                   ROI methods. Firstly we consider conventional ROIs;
                   secondly, we present a novel tractography-based
                   approach. The problems of both methods are explored,
                   particularly of high variance and ROI definition. The
                   potential benefits of the tractographic method for
                   neuropsychiatric conditions with subtle and diffuse

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Despite its potential for
                   visualizing white matter fiber tracts in vivo,
                   diffusion tensor tractography has found only limited
                   applications in clinical research in which specific
                   anatomic connections between distant regions need to be
                   evaluated. We introduce a robust method for fiber
                   clustering that guides the separation of anatomically
                   distinct fiber tracts and enables further estimation of
                   anatomic connectivity between distant brain regions.
                   METHODS: Line scanning diffusion tensor images (LSDTI)
                   were acquired on a 1.5T magnet. Regions of interest for
                   several anatomically distinct fiber tracts were
                   manually drawn; then, white matter tractography was
                   performed by using the Runge-Kutta method to
                   interpolate paths (fiber traces) following the major
                   directions of diffusion, in which traces were seeded
                   only within the defined regions of interest. Next, a
                   fully automatic procedure was applied to fiber traces,
                   grouping them according to a pairwise similarity
                   function that takes into account the shapes of the
                   fibers and their spatial locations. RESULTS: We
                   demonstrated the ability of the clustering algorithm to
                   separate several fiber tracts which are otherwise
                   difficult to define (left and right fornix, uncinate
                   fasciculus and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, and
                   corpus callosum fibers). CONCLUSION: This method
                   successfully delineates fiber tracts that can be
                   further analyzed for clinical research purposes.
                   Hypotheses regarding specific fiber connections and
                   their abnormalities in various neuropsychiatric
                   disorders can now be tested.},

  abstract       = {PURPOSE: To correct eddy-current artifacts in
                   diffusion tensor (DT) images without the need to obtain
                   auxiliary scans for the sole purpose of correction.
                   MATERIALS AND METHODS: DT images are susceptible to
                   distortions caused by eddy currents induced by large
                   diffusion gradients. We propose a new postacquisition
                   correction algorithm that does not require any
                   auxiliary reference scans. It also avoids the
                   problematic procedure of cross-correlating images with
                   significantly different contrasts. A linear model is
                   used to describe the dependence of distortion
                   parameters (translation, scaling, and shear) on the
                   diffusion gradients. The model is solved numerically to
                   provide an individual correction for every
                   diffusion-weighted (DW) image. RESULTS: The assumptions
                   of the linear model were successfully verified in a
                   series of experiments on a silicon oil phantom. The
                   correction obtained for this phantom was compared with
                   correction obtained by a previously published method.
                   The algorithm was then shown to markedly reduce
                   eddy-current distortions in DT images from human
                   subjects. CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm can
                   accurately correct eddy-current artifacts in DT images.
                   Its principal advantages are that only images with
                   comparable signals and contrasts are cross-correlated,
                   and no additional scans are required.},

                   resonance diffusion imaging to provide information
                   about anatomical connectivity in the brain, by
                   measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white
                   matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly
                   derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy
                   (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the
                   local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are
                   starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical
                   analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to
                   development, degeneration and disease. However, optimal
                   analysis is compromised by the use of standard
                   registration algorithms; there has not to date been a
                   satisfactory solution to the question of how to align
                   FA images from multiple subjects in a way that allows
                   for valid conclusions to be drawn from the subsequent
                   voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of
                   the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been
                   resolved. In this paper, we present a new method that
                   aims to solve these issues via (a) carefully tuned
                   non-linear registration, followed by (b) projection
                   onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the
                   ‘‘mean FA skeleton’’). We refer to this new approach as
                   Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to
                   improve the sensitivity, objectivity and
                   interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion
                   imaging studies. We describe TBSS in detail and present
                   example TBSS results from several diffusion imaging

                   rapidly, often at the detriment of the image quality.
                   We propose a new variational framework that
                   specifically targets low quality DT-MRI. The Rician
                   nature of the noise on the images leads us to a maximum
                   likelihood strategy to estimate the tensor field. To
                   further reduce the noise, we optimally exploit the
                   spatial correlation by adding to the estimation an
                   anisotropic regularization term. This criterion is
                   easily optimized thanks to the use of the recently
                   introduced Log-Euclidean metrics. Results on real
                   clinical data show promising improvements of fiber

                   made it possible to reveal white matter anatomy and to
                   detect neurological abnormalities in children. However,
                   the clinical use of this technique is hampered by the
                   lack of a normal standard of reference. The goal of
                   this study was to initiate the establishment of a
                   database of DTI images in children, which can be used
                   as a normal standard of reference for diagnosis of
                   pediatric neurological abnormalities. Seven pediatric
                   volunteers and 23 pediatric patients (age range: 0-54
                   months) referred for clinical MR examinations, but
                   whose brains were shown to be normal, underwent
                   anatomical and DTI acquisitions on a 1.5 T MR scanner.
                   The white matter maturation, as observed on DTI color
                   maps, was described and illustrated. Changes in
                   diffusion fractional anisotropy (FA), average apparent
                   diffusion constant (ADCave), and T2-weighted (T2W)
                   signal intensity were quantified in 12 locations to
                   characterize the anatomical variability of the
                   maturation process. Almost all prominent white matter
                   tracts could be identified from birth, although their
                   anisotropy was often low. The evolution of FA, shape,
                   and size of the white matter tracts comprised generally
                   three phases: rapid changes during the first 12 months;
                   slow modifications during the second year; and relative
                   stability after 24 months. The time courses of FA,
                   ADCave, and T2W signal intensity confirmed our visual
                   observations that maturation of the white matter and
                   the normality of its architecture can be assessed with
                   DTI in young children. The database is available online
                   and is expected to foster the use of this promising
                   technique in the diagnosis of pediatric pathologies.},

                   powerful tool for the non-invasive depiction of the
                   white matter architecture in the human brain. However,
                   due to limitations in the underlying tensor model, the
                   technique is often unable to reconstruct correct
                   trajectories in heterogeneous fiber arrangements, such
                   as axonal crossings. A novel tractography method based
                   on fast marching (FM) is proposed which is capable of
                   resolving fiber crossings and also permits trajectories
                   to branch. It detects heterogeneous fiber arrangements
                   by incorporating information from the entire diffusion
                   tensor. The FM speed function is adapted to the local
                   tensor characteristics, allowing in particular to
                   maintain the front evolution direction in crossing
                   situations. In addition, the FM's discretization error
                   is reduced by increasing the number of considered
                   possible front evolution directions. The performance of
                   the technique is demonstrated in artificial data and in
                   the healthy human brain. Comparisons with standard FM
                   tractography and conventional line propagation
                   algorithms show that, in the presence of interfering
                   structures, the proposed method is more accurate in
                   reconstructing trajectories. The in vivo results

                   pathways are consistent with known anatomy and that

                   fiber correspondences and clusters across a population
                   of brains. Our input is a collection of paths from
                   tractography in every brain. Using spectral methods we
                   embed each path as a vector in a high dimensional
                   space. We create the embedding space so that it is
                   common across all brains, consequently similar paths in
                   all brains will map to points near each other in the
                   space. By performing clustering in this space we are
                   able to find matching fiber tract clusters in all
                   brains. In addition, we automatically obtain
                   correspondence of tractographic paths across brains: by
                   selecting one or several paths of interest in one
                   brain, the most similar paths in all brains are
                   obtained as the nearest points in the high-dimensional

                   the human brain. Combining DTI data with the
                   computational methods of MR tractography,
                   neuroscientists can estimate the locations and sizes of
                   nerve bundles (white matter pathways) that course
                   through the human brain. Neuroscientists have used
                   visualization techniques to better understand
                   tractography data, but they often struggle with the
                   abundance and complexity of the pathways. In this
                   paper, we describe a novel set of interaction
                   techniques that make it easier to explore and interpret
                   such pathways. Specifically, our application allows
                   neuroscientists to place and interactively manipulate
                   box or ellipsoid-shaped regions to selectively display
                   pathways that pass through specific anatomical areas.
                   These regions can be used in coordination with a simple
                   and flexible query language which allows for arbitrary
                   combinations of these queries using Boolean logic
                   operators. A representation of the cortical surface is
                   provided for specifying queries of pathways that may be
                   relevant to gray matter structures and for displaying
                   activation information obtained from functional
                   magnetic resonance imaging. By precomputing the
                   pathways and their statistical properties, we obtain
                   the speed necessary for interactive question-and-answer
                   sessions with brain researchers. We survey some
                   questions that researchers have been asking about
                   tractography data and show how our system can be used

                   tensor imaging. Recently, several high angular

                   describing fibre crossing within a single voxel. Among
                   them, q-ball imaging (QBI), inherited from the q-space
                   method, relies on a spherical Radon transform providing
                   a direct relationship between the diffusion-weighted MR

                   Experimental validation of these methods in a model

                   methods and to optimize them. A diffusion phantom made
                   up of two textile rayon fibre (comparable in diameter
                   to axons) bundles, crossing at $90^o$, was designed and
                   dedicated to ex vivo q-ball validation on a clinical
                   scanner. Normalized ODFs were calculated inside regions
                   of interest corresponding to monomodal and bimodal
                   configurations of underlying structures.
                   Threedimensional renderings of ODFs revealed monomodal
                   shapes for voxels containing single-fibre population
                   and bimodal patterns for voxels located within the
                   crossing area. Principal orientations were estimated
                   from ODFs and were compared with a priori structural
                   fibre directions, validating efficiency of QBI for
                   depicting fibre crossing. In the homogeneous regions,
                   QBI detected the fibre angle with an accuracy of $19^o$
                   and in the fibre-crossing region with an accuracy of
                   $30^o$.},

  abstract       = {Most of the approaches dedicated to fiber tracking
                   from diffusion-weighted MR data rely on a tensor model.
                   However, the tensor model can only resolve a single
                   fiber orientation within each imaging voxel. New
                   emerging approaches have been proposed to obtain a
                   better representation of the diffusion process
                   occurring in fiber crossing. In this paper, we adapt a
                   tracking algorithm to the q-ball representation, which
                   results from a spherical Radon transform of high
                   angular resolution data. This algorithm is based on a
                   Monte-Carlo strategy, using regularized particle
                   trajectories to sample the white matter geometry. The
                   method is validated using a phantom of bundle crossing
                   made up of haemodialysis fibers. The method is also
                   applied to the detection of the auditory tract in three
                   human subjects.},

                   motivated by medical applications in which variation
                   analysis of known bundles of fiber tracts in the human
                   brain is desired. To include the anatomical knowledge
                   in the clustering, we invoke an atlas of fiber tracts,
                   labeled by the number of bundles of interest. In this
                   work, we construct such an atlas and use it to cluster
                   all fiber tracts in the white matter. To build the
                   atlas, we start with a set of labeled ROIs specified by
                   an expert and extract the fiber tracts initiating from
                   each ROI. Affine registration is used to project the
                   extracted fiber tracts of each subject to the atlas,
                   whereas their B-spline representation is used to
                   efficiently compare them to the fiber tracts in the
                   atlas and assign cluster labels. Expert visual
                   inspection of the result confirms that the proposed

                   the optimal value of the diffusion weighting factor b
                   for estimating white-matter fiber orientations using
                   diffusion MRI with a standard spherical sampling
                   scheme. We devise an algorithm for determining the
                   optimal echo time, pulse width, and pulse separation in
                   the pulsed-gradient spinecho sequence for a specific
                   value of b. The Monte Carlo simulations provide an
                   estimate of the optimal value of b for recovering one
                   and two fiber orientations. We show that the optimum is
                   largely independent of the noise level in the
                   measurements and the number of gradient directions and
                   that the optimum depends only weakly on the diffusion
                   anisotropy, the maximum gradient strength, and the spin
                   – spin relaxation time. The optimum depends strongly on
                   the mean diffusivity. In brain tissue, the optima we
                   estimate are in the ranges [0.7, 1.0] \times 10^9 s
                   m^{-2} and [2.2, 2.8] \times 10^9 s m^{-2} for the one-
                   and two-fiber cases, respectively. The best b for
                   estimating the fractional anisotropy is slightly higher
                   than for estimating fiber directions in the one-fiber
                   case and slightly lower in the two-fiber case. To
                   estimate Tr(D) in the onefiber case, the optimal
                   setting is higher still. Simulations suggest that a
                   ratio of high to low b measurements of 5 to 1 is a good
                   compromise for measuring fiber directions and size and
                   shape indices.},

                   were used to measure the occipital lobe fiber tracts
                   connecting the two hemispheres in individual human
                   subjects. These tracts are important for normal vision.
                   Also, damage to portions of these tracts is associated
                   with alexia. To assess the reliability of the DTI-FT
                   measurements, occipital-callosal projections were
                   estimated from each subject's left and right
                   hemispheres independently. The left and right estimates
                   converged onto the same positions within the splenium.
                   We further characterized the properties of the
                   estimated occipital-callosal fiber tracts by combining
                   them with functional MRI. We used functional MRI to
                   identify visual field maps in cortex and labeled fibers
                   by the cortical functional response at the fiber
                   endpoint. This labeling reveals a regular organization
                   of the fibers within the splenium. The dorsal visual
                   maps (dorsal V3, V3A, V3B, V7) send projections through
                   a large band in the middle of the splenium, whereas
                   ventral visual maps (ventral V3, V4) send projections
                   through the inferior-anterior corner of the splenium.
                   The agreement between the independent left/right
                   estimates, further supported by previous descriptions
                   of homologous tracts in macaque, validates the DTI-FT
                   methods. However, a principal limitation of these
                   methods is low sensitivity: a large number of fiber
                   tracts that connect homotopic regions of ventral and
                   lateral visual cortex were undetected. We conclude that
                   most of the estimated tracts are real and can be
                   localized with a precision of 1-2 mm, but many tracts
                   are missed because of data and algorithm limitations.},

                   data are applied to drive probabilistic fibre tracking,
                   designed to provide estimates of anatomical cerebral
                   connectivity. The behaviour of the PAS function in the
                   presence of realistic data noise is modelled for a
                   range of single and multiple fibre configurations. This
                   allows probability density functions (PDFs) to be
                   generated that are parametrized according to the
                   anisotropy of individual fibre populations. The PDFs
                   are incorporated in a probabilistic fibre-tracking
                   method to allow the estimation of whole-brain maps of
                   anatomical connection probability. These methods are
                   applied in two exemplar experiments in the
                   corticospinal tract to show that it is possible to
                   connect the entire primary motor cortex (M1) when
                   tracing from the cerebral peduncles, and that the
                   reverse experiment of tracking from M1 successfully
                   identifies high probability connection via the
                   pyramidal tracts. Using the extracted PAS in
                   probabilistic fibre tracking allows higher specificity
                   and sensitivity than previously reported fibre tracking
                   using diffusion-weighted MRI in the corticospinal

                   borders and cytoarchitecture cannot be visualized in a
                   living brain used for functional studies. Here, we used
                   diffusion-weighted and functional MRI to test
                   structure-function relations directly. Distinct
                   neocortical regions were defined as volumes having
                   similar connectivity profiles and borders identified
                   where connectivity changed. Without using prior
                   information, we found an abrupt profile change where
                   the border between supplementary motor area (SMA) and
                   pre-SMA is expected. Consistent with this anatomical
                   assignment, putative SMA and pre-SMA connected to motor

                   This finding demonstrates a strong relationship between

                   associated with asymmetry of the cerebral cortex (grey
                   matter) and connectivity (white matter). Grey matter
                   asymmetry, most likely linked to language has been
                   identified with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using
                   T1-weighted images. Differences in white matter
                   obtained with this technique are less consistent,
                   probably due to the relative insensitivity of the T1
                   contrast to the ultrastructure of white matter.
                   Furthermore, previous VBM studies failed to find
                   differences related to handedness in either grey or
                   white matter. We revisited these issues and
                   investigated two independent groups of subjects with
                   diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) for asymmetries in white
                   matter composition. Using voxel-based statistical
                   analyses an asymmetry of the arcuate fascicle was
                   observed, with higher fractional anisotropy in the left
                   hemisphere. In addition, we show differences related to
                   handedness in the white matter underneath the
                   precentral gyrus contralateral to the dominant hand.
                   Remarkably, these findings were very robust, even when
                   investigating small groups of subjects. This highlights
                   the sensitivity of DTI for white matter tissue
                   differences, making it an ideal tool to study small
                   patient populations.},

                   coefficients and anisotropy indices is affected by
                   image distortions that arise from residual eddy
                   currents produced by the diffusion-sensitizing
                   gradients. Correction methods that coregister
                   diffusion-weighted and non-diffusion-weighted images
                   suffer from the different contrast properties inherent
                   in these image types. Here, a postprocessing correction
                   scheme is introduced that makes use of the inverse
                   characteristics of distortions generated by gradients
                   with reversed polarity. In this approach, only
                   diffusion-weighted images with identical contrast are
                   included for correction. That is,
                   non-diffusion-weighted images are not needed as a
                   reference for registration. Furthermore, the
                   acquisition of an additional dataset with moderate
                   diffusion-weighting as suggested by Haselgrove and
                   Moore (Magn Reson Med 1996;36:960-964) is not required.
                   With phantom data it is shown that the theoretically
                   expected symmetry of distortions is preserved in the
                   images to a very high degree, demonstrating the
                   practicality of the new method. Results from human

  abstract       = {Image distortion due to field gradient eddy currents
                   can create image artifacts in diffusion-weighted MR
                   images. These images, acquired by measuring the
                   attenuation of NMR signal due to directionally
                   dependent diffusion, have recently been shown to be
                   useful in the diagnosis and assessment of acute stroke
                   and in mapping of tissue structure. This work presents
                   an improvement on the spin-echo (SE) diffusion sequence
                   that displays less distortion and consequently improves
                   image quality. Adding a second refocusing pulse
                   provides better image quality with less distortion at
                   no cost in scanning efficiency or effectiveness, and
                   allows more flexible diffusion gradient timing. By
                   adjusting the timing of the diffusion gradients, eddy
                   currents with a single exponential decay constant can
                   be nulled, and eddy currents with similar decay
                   constants can be greatly reduced. This new sequence is
                   demonstrated in phantom measurements and in diffusion
                   anisotropy images of normal human brain.},

                   quantifying streamline-based diffusion fiber tracking
                   methods in terms of probability of connection between
                   points and/or regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
                   commonly used streamline approach is adapted to exploit
                   the uncertainty in the orientation of the principal
                   direction of diffusion defined for each image voxel.
                   Running the streamline process repeatedly using Monte
                   Carlo methods to exploit this inherent uncertainty
                   generates maps of connection probability. Uncertainty
                   is defined by interpreting the shape of the diffusion
                   orientation profile provided by the diffusion tensor in
                   terms of the underlying microstructure. RESULTS: Two
                   candidates for describing the uncertainty in the
                   diffusion tensor are proposed and maps of probability
                   of connection to chosen start points or regions are
                   generated in a number of major tracts. CONCLUSION: The
                   methods presented provide a generic framework for
                   utilizing streamline methods to generate probabilistic
                   maps of connectivity.},

                   previously been used to define large white-matter
                   tracts in the living human brain, but this technique
                   has had limited success in tracing pathways into gray
                   matter. Here we identified specific connections between
                   human thalamus and cortex using a novel probabilistic
                   tractography algorithm with diffusion imaging data.
                   Classification of thalamic gray matter based on
                   cortical connectivity patterns revealed distinct
                   subregions whose locations correspond to nuclei

                   distortion due to field gradient eddy currents can
                   create image artifacts in diffusion-weighted MR images.
                   These images, acquired by measuring the attenuation of
                   NMR signal due to directionally dependent diffusion,
                   have recently been shown to be useful in the diagnosis
                   and assessment of acute stroke and in mapping of tissue
                   structure. This work presents an improvement on the
                   spin-echo (SE) diffusion sequence that displays less
                   distortion and consequently improves image quality.
                   Adding a second refocusing pulse provides better image
                   quality with less distortion at no cost in scanning
                   efficiency or effectiveness, and allows more flexible
                   diffusion gradient timing. By adjusting the timing of
                   the diffusion gradients, eddy currents with a single
                   exponential decay constant can be nulled, and eddy
                   currents with similar decay constants can be greatly
                   reduced. This new sequence is demonstrated in phantom
                   measurements and in diffusion anisotropy images of
                   normal human brain. Magn Reson Med 49:177-182, 2003. ©

                   apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional
                   anisotropy (FA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight healthy
                   adults and 20 healthy neonates were examined with a
                   3.0-T head-only magnetic resonance (MR) imaging unit by
                   using a single-shot diffusion-tensor sequence. Trace
                   ADC maps, FA maps, directional maps of the putative
                   directions of white matter (WM) tracts, and
                   fiber-tracking maps were obtained. Regions of
                   interest-eight in WM and one in gray matter (GM)-were
                   predefined for the ADC and FA measurements. The Student
                   t test was used to compare FA and ADC between adults
                   and neonates, whereas the Tukey multiple-comparison
                   test was used to compare FA and ADC in different brain
                   regions in the adult and neonate groups. RESULTS: A
                   global elevation in ADC (P <.001) in both GM and WM and
                   a reduction in FA (P <.001) in WM were observed in
                   neonates as compared with these values in adults. In
                   addition, significant regional variations in FA and ADC
                   were observed in both groups. Regional variations in FA
                   and ADC were less remarkable in adults, whereas
                   neonates had consistently higher FA values and lower
                   ADC values in the central WM as compared with these
                   values in the peripheral WM. Fiber tracking revealed
                   only major WM tracts in the neonates but fibers
                   extending to the peripheral WM in the adults.
                   CONCLUSION: There were regional differences in FA and
                   ADC values in the neonates; such variations were less
